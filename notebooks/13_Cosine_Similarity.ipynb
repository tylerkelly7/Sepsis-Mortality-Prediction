      "EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) INDICATION:  year old man with sp liver transplant with prolonged course, currently trached with MDR E coli PNA, increasing O2 requirements recently ?interval change ?interval change IMPRESSION: Compared to chest radiographs  through  one at 23:48. Moderate pulmonary edema seen best in the right lung has worsened. There is substantial new right basal consolidation, and increase in left perihilar consolidation, either combinations of edema and atelectasis or pneumonia. Cardiac silhouette is partially obscured but moderate cardiomegaly appears to have increased. Tracheostomy tube in standard placement. Left dual channel dialysis catheters end in the SVC and close to the superior cavoatrial junction. Right jugular line ends at the thoracic inlet, all unchanged. There may be new fluid in the previously air containing externalized right pleural space, a function of cardiac decompensation. EXAMINATION: CHEST (PORTABLE AP) INDICATION:  year old man with LLL consolidation and sepsis Interval changes COMPARISON: Chest radiographs from  through  Chest CT dated  FINDINGS: AP portable view of the chest provided. Compared to the  study, lung volumes are slightly increased. Moderate pulmonary edema has improved. The left basilar and perihilar consolidation is less confluent, although persistent. The cardiac silhouette is again partially obscured, but mild cardiomegaly is likely stable allowing for the AP projection and previously low lung volumes. The externalized right pleural space is unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. Cardiopulmonary support lines and tubes are in unchanged position. IMPRESSION: 1. Pulmonary edema has improved and is now mild. 2. Persistent left lower lobe consolidation concerning for pneumonia. 3. Mild cardiomegaly. EXAMINATION: ABDOMEN US (COMPLETE STUDY) INDICATION:  year old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, worsening jaundice, pruritus, and hepatorenal syndrome. (note: also has history of cholecystectomy), evaluate for portal vein thrombosis given worsening jaundice. Also has HRS, so please evaluate kidneys too. TECHNIQUE: Gray scale, color, and spectral Doppler evaluation of the abdomen was performed. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: Liver: The hepatic parenchyma is coarsened and nodular.. No focal liver lesions are identified. There is small volume perihepatic ascites. Bile ducts: There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common hepatic duct measures 3 mm. Gallbladder: The gallbladder was not visualized. Pancreas: The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas. Spleen: The spleen demonstrates normal echotexture, and measures 16.4 cm. Kidneys: The right kidney measures 11.5 cm. The left kidney measures 11.3 cm. No stones, masses, or hydronephrosis are identified in either kidney. Doppler evaluation: The main portal vein is notable for lack of demonstrable internal flow, which could be due to thrombosis or slow (undetectable) flow.. Main portal vein velocity is not detectable. Right and left portal veins are notable for lack of demonstrable internal flow. The main hepatic artery is patent, with appropriate waveform. Right, middle and left hepatic veins are patent, with appropriate waveforms. Splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein are not visualized. IMPRESSION: 1. Flow within the main, right, and left portal veins is not detectable, highly concerning for portal thrombus. CT or MR could be obtained for further evaluation if clinically indicated. 2. Cirrhotic liver with marked splenomegaly and trace perihepatic ascites. No suspicious liver lesion is detected. 3. Normal appearance of the kidneys. NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with , M.D. by , M.D. on the telephone on  at 11:21 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings. EXAMINATION: DUPLEX DOPP ABDPEL PORT INDICATION: transplant vasculature TECHNIQUE: Gray scale, color, and spectral Doppler evaluation of the abdomen was performed. COMPARISON: Prior liver ultrasound dated . FINDINGS: Study is mildly limited by poor acoustic windows related to patient body habitus. Liver: The hepatic parenchyma is within normal limits. No focal liver lesions are identified. There is no ascites. The previously seen perihepatic hematoma is not identified. There is trace fluid adjacent to the left lobe of the liver. Bile ducts: There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The common hepatic duct could not be identified due to poor sonographic windows. Gallbladder: The gallbladder is surgically absent. Pancreas: The pancreas is largely obscured by overlying bowel gas, with imaged portions of the pancreas appearing within normal limits. Doppler evaluation: The main portal vein is patent, with flow in the appropriate direction. Main portal vein velocity is 60.9 cmsec. Right and left portal veins are patent, with antegrade flow. The main hepatic artery is patent with a resistive index of 0.80, previously 0.76. There is slightly decreased antegrade diastolic flow compared with the immediate prior study. The right and left hepatic arteries could not be identified on the present study. Right, middle and left hepatic veins are patent, with appropriate waveforms. IMPRESSION: 1. Patent hepatic vasculature. 2. Slight interval increase in main hepatic artery resistive index, now measuring 0.8 with decreased antegrade diastolic flow. The left and right hepatic arteries could not be identified, likely due to technical limitations related to patient body habitus. Continued attention on anticipated follow-up imaging is recommended. INDICATION:  POD7 DDLT with acute thrombus of hepatic artery  transplant hepatic artery without flow, request angio and intervention COMPARISON: Liver doppler US on . TECHNIQUE: OPERATORS: Dr.  and Dr.  radiologist performed the procedure. Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and has reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia was administered. MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia. CONTRAST: 20 ml of Optiray contrast. 91 mL of is Visipaque contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 10 min, 620 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Right common femoral artery access. 2. Celiac arteriogram. 3. Common hepatic arteriogram with cone beam CT. 4. Successful embolization of the splenic artery with an 8 mm Amplatzer plug. 5. Celiac arteriogram post splenic artery embolization. 6. Doppler ultrasound of the main and right hepatic arteries. 7. Right common femoral arteriogram. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. Both groins were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Using palpatory and fluoroscopic guidance, the right common femoral artery was punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid-femoral head. A 0.018 wire was passed easily into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was made over the needle. Then the inner dilator and wire were removed and a  wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 5  sheath which was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm flush. An C2 glide catheter was advanced over  wire into the aorta. The wire was removed and the celiac artery was selectively cannulated and a small contrast injection was made to confirm position. A celiac arteriogram was performed. The Glidewire was not through the catheter and the Glidewire and catheter were used to cannulate the common hepatic artery. Common hepatic artery with cone beam CT was performed. Next, the catheter was pulled back and the Glidewire and catheter were used to cannulate the splenic artery. The wire was removed and an 8 mm Amplatzer plug was deployed in the splenic artery. Celiac arteriogram post splenic artery embolization was performed. Next, Doppler ultrasound of the main and right hepatic arteries was performed. The catheter was removed and the right common femoral arteriogram was performed from the sheath. Next, an Angio-Seal was placed. Manual pressure was held until hemostasis was achieved. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: 1. Initial celiac arteriogram demonstrates preferential flow into the splenic artery with delayed flow into the common hepatic, main hepatic and intrahepatic artery branches. 2. Common hepatic arteriogram with cone beam CT demonstrates two focal areas of narrowing, one at the junction of the recipient proper hepatic and donor splenic artery as well as the junction of the donor splenic artery and donor proper hepatic artery. In addition, there is also a focal kink at the mid point of the donor splenic artery. 3. Post splenic embolization celiac arteriogram demonstrates significantly improved flow into the common hepatic, main and intrahepatic arteries. The previously described focal areas of narrowing are less significant with the improved flow. Arterial flow to the spleen is diminished however collateral arteries provide some residual flow to the spleen. 4. Doppler ultrasound of the main and right hepatic arteries demonstrate good arterial waveforms with brisk upstrokes and maintain diastolic flow, this is improved compared to Doppler ultrasound performed prior to the procedure on . The left hepatic artery could not be evaluated due to overlying bandages. 5. Right common femoral arteriogram demonstrates appropriate access site at the level of the mid femoral head above the bifurcation of the deep femoral artery and adequate diameter of the common femoral artery. IMPRESSION: Successful Amplatzer plug embolization of the splenic artery. As a result of the splenic artery embolization, the arterial flow to the transplant liver was significantly improved both angiographically and by intra-procedural Doppler ultrasound examination, with detailed findings above. RECOMMENDATION(S): Serial Doppler ultrasound should be performed in the next  hr, and if there is diminished hepatic arterial flow, hepatic artery stenting can be considered.

COMPARISON: Chest radiograph on . TECHNIQUE: OPERATORS: Dr.  and Dr.  radiologist performed the procedure. Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and has reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 25 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 25 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl and versed. CONTRAST: None. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 3.2 min,  MGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The right upper chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A 23cm tip-to-cuff length catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire through which the catheter was threaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures. Dermabond and Steri-strips were also used to close the venotomy incision site. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and both lumens were capped. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: Patent right internal jugular vein. Final fluoroscopic image showing tunneled HD catheter with tip terminating in the right atrium. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 23cm tip-to-cuff length tunneled dialysis line. The tip of the catheter terminates in the right atrium. The catheter is ready for use.

EXAMINATION: CT CHEST W CONTRAST INDICATION:  year old man with ho EC fistula, and pleural effusion please evaluate pleural effusion and lung parenchyma TECHNIQUE: MD CT axial images of the chest were obtained after administration of intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformats, including coronal, sagittal and maximal intensity projection images were obtained and reviewed on PACs. DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 2.5 s, 39.7 cm; CTDIvol  19.6 mGy (Body) DLP  775.6 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body)  776 mGy-cm. COMPARISON: CTA chest from  FINDINGS: NECK, THORACIC INLET, AXILLAE, CHEST WALL: The imaged thyroid gland is homogeneous in attenuation without focal nodularity. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. However, there are numerous lymph nodes that remain prominent since . Otherwise, there are punctate hyperdense materials within the left axilla, which may represent residual contrast material from the injection for the subdiaphragmatic portion of the exam. Enteric tube is seen within the esophagus with hyperdense material layering within the lower thoracic esophagus. UPPER ABDOMEN: Please refer to the dedicated CT abdomen and pelvis for details on subdiaphragmatic findings. MEDIASTINUM: There are numerous lymph nodes in the mediastinum measuring up to 8 mm in the short axis, most notable in the right upper paratracheal station, not significant changed since . HILA: There is no hilar lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria. HEART and PERICARDIUM: Trace pericardial effusion is likely physiologic. The heart size is within normal limits. Left subclavian central line tip terminates in the right atrium. There is moderate coronary calcifications and aortic valvular calcifications. PLEURA: New since , there is loculated appearance of the left pleural effusion, which has somewhat decreased since prior exam. Streaky hyperdense material in the left apical fluid component (02:22) may represent layering debris, as is irregular shaped hyperdensity along the left paramedian pleura (02:37). Patient is status post pigtail catheter placement on the right, which remains in small amount of relatively simple appearing pleural effusion, decreased in size since . Enhancement of the pleura is new, though may be related to phase of contrast compared to . This, however, may represent inflammatory or infectious etiology, such as empyema. LUNG: 1. PARENCHYMA: There is relatively heterogeneous density of the lung parenchyma in the right lower lobe, which may be secondary to residual contrast enhancement of the normal parenchyma in the setting of infiltrate (02:37), which is better demonstrated on the postcontrast exam which is part of the abdomen pelvis series from the same day (303:7). Moreover, compared to prior exam, the amount of consolidation and collapse in the right lower lobe has increased, now involving most of the lobe. In addition, there is increased atelectasis of the right upper and the right middle lobes. Mild right worse than left septal thickening may be due to interstitial pulmonary edema. Left lower lobe consolidation is unchanged from prior and likely represent atelectasis. Punctate calcifications in the left lower lobe likely represent granulomas. 2. AIRWAYS: The airways are patent to the subsegmental levels. 3. VESSELS: The ascending, descending aorta are normal in caliber. The main pulmonary artery is mildly dilated, measuring up to 3.1 cm (02:24), may represent pulmonary arterial hypertension. Evaluation for pulmonary embolism is limited on the current study.

In tube 1, which is located close to midline, contrast is noted to flow anterograde into the right lower quadrant, presumably within a loop of small bowel, which appears to connect with the right lower quadrant ileostomy. In tube 2, which is just lateral to tube 1, contrast is noted to flow within the left upper quadrant presumably within a loop of small bowel. This loop appears to be partially blind ending. In tube 3, which is lateral to tube 2, no contrast is seen filling loops of small or large bowel. In tube 4, which is just lateral to tube 1, contrasts is seen filling a loop of small bowel, which appears to connect with the right lower quadrant ileostomy. At this point, Optiray was administered through the oral route, which was noted to fill the stomach and duodenum. Finally, contrast was instilled into the right lower quadrant ileostomy, though was not seen to fill the ileostomy, nor connect with loops of small or large bowel. IMPRESSION: Please see above for further details regarding enterocutaneous fistulae and results of multiple cannulated tracts, including the right lower quadrant ileostomy.

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 27 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl and Versed CONTRAST: None FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 1.3 min, 4 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Tunneled non-dialysis line placement PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right external jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A triple-lumen non power central venous catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire through which the catheter was threaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and each lumen was capped. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures. Dermabond was used to close the venotomy incision site. Steri-Strips were applied. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: Patent right external jugular vein.

FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 2 min, 15 mGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The left upper chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent left internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A 27cm tip-to-cuff length catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire through which the catheter was threaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures. Dermabond was used to close the venotomy incision site.

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 0 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 60 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 3.8 min, 24.6 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Tunneled non-dialysis line placement PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patients healthcare proxy. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The patients pre-existing right internal jugular central venous catheter was deemed too cranial to replace, and was therefore left in place. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A double-lumen  catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire through which the catheter was threaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and each lumen was capped. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures. Derma bond was used to close the venotomy incision site. Steri-Strips were applied.

FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 4.6 min, 81 mGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the health care proxy. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced into the IVC. A triple-lumen central venous catheter was advanced over the wire into the superior vena cava with the tip in the cavoatrial junction. All 3 access ports were aspirated, flushed and capped. The catheter was secured to the skin with a 0 silk suture and sterile dressings were applied. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. Next, we proceeded to advance the NG tube into a post pyloric position.

ANESTHESIA: The patient was intubated and sedated. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site MEDICATIONS: 1 lidocaine. CONTRAST: 150 ml of Optiray contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 45 min, 482 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Left common femoral artery access, ultrasound-guided. 2. Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin and left groin. 3. Left common femoral artery arteriogram. 4. Selective right L3 lumbar artery arteriogram. 5. Gel-Foam and coil embolization of the right L3 lumbar artery and post embolization arteriogram. 6. Selective right L4 lumbar artery arteriogram. 7. Gel-Foam and coil embolization of the right L4 lumbar artery and post embolization arteriogram. 8. Right external iliac artery arteriogram. 9. Selective right lateral circumflex artery arteriogram. 10. Gel-Foam and coil embolization of the right lateral circumflex artery and post embolization arteriogram. 11. Right internal iliac arteriogram. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patients health care proxy. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin was performed. Images were stored in PACs. A tiny (4 mm) pseudoaneurysm was identified at the previous site of much larger pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery. Ultrasound evaluation of the left groin was performed. Images were stored in PACs. A sub cm pseudoaneurysm was identified, without flow, and likely thrombosed. Using ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid-femoral head. An 0.018 wire was passed easily into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was made over the needle. Then the inner dilator and wire were removed and a  wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 5  sheath which was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm flush. A contrast injection was performed and the sheath, to confirm positioning in the left common femoral artery. A left common femoral artery arteriogram was performed. A SOS catheter was then advanced into the abdominal aorta over  wire. The wire was removed, and the catheter was used to select the right L3 lumbar artery. Contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. A right L3 lumbar artery arteriogram was performed. A headliner wire and STC micro catheter were then advanced into the right L3 lumbar artery. The wire was removed, and a contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. Gel-Foam embolization was then performed in the right L3 lumbar artery, followed by coil embolization with a 3 mm x 3 cm Hilal coil, followed by a 4 mm x 10 cm detachable Concerto coil. A post embolization arteriogram was performed in the right L3 lumbar artery, demonstrating occlusion. The SOS catheter was then disengaged from the L3 lumbar artery and used to select the right L4 lumbar artery. Contrast was injected to confirm positioning. A right L4 lumbar artery arteriogram was performed. A headliner wire and STC micro catheter were then advanced into the right L4 lumbar artery. The wire was removed, and a contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. Gel-Foam embolization was then performed in the right L4 lumbar artery, followed by coil embolization with a 3 mm x 3 cm Hilal coil, followed by a 4 mm x 10 cm detachable Concerto coil. A post embolization arteriogram was performed in the right L4 lumbar artery, demonstrating occlusion. A Glidewire was then advanced through the SOS catheter into the right external iliac artery. The 5  sheath was then exchanged for a Balkan sheath, which was advanced over the bifurcation into the right common femoral artery. A straight flush catheter was then advanced over a wire into the right external iliac artery. The wire was removed, and a contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. A right external iliac artery arteriogram was performed. The straight flush catheter was advanced over the wire into the right internal iliac artery. The wire was removed, and a contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. A right internal iliac arteriogram was performed. The straight flush catheter was then exchanged for a C2 Cobra glide catheter over  wire. The C2 Cobra glide catheter was used to select the right lateral circumflex artery. A micro wire and micro catheter were then advanced into the right lateral circumflex artery. The wire was removed, and a contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. A right lateral circumflex artery arteriogram was performed. Gel-Foam embolization was then performed in the right lateral cicrumflex artery, followed by coil embolization with a 3 mm x 4 cm detachable Concerto coil, followed by coid embolization with a 4 mm x 10 cm detachable concerto coil. A post embolization arteriogram was performed in the right lateral circumflex artery, demonstrating occlusion. The wires and catheters were then removed. Hemostasis was achieved with an Angio-Seal device and manual pressure. A sterile dressing was applied. There were no immediate complications and the patient tolerated the procedure. FINDINGS: 1. Left common femoral artery arteriogram demonstrates a 4 mm pseudoaneurysm arising from the left superficial femoral artery at the site of entry of the arterial pressure measurement catheter. This aneurysm corresponds with a known site of bleeding identified on the CTA. This aneurysm is too small to treat, and at the end of the study, no flow was seen within it on ultrasound, suggesting that it may have thrombosed. 2. Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin demonstrates a 2-3 mm residual pseudoaneurysm at the anterior surface of the right CFA, at the previous site of much larger pseudoaneurysm arising from the right common femoral artery, too small to treat. This will likely thrombose and is not the contributor for ongoing bleeding. 3. Right L3 lumbar artery arteriogram demonstrates punctate foci of active extravasation. 4. Gel-Foam and coil embolization of the right L3 lumbar artery and post embolization arteriogram demonstrating stasis of the vessel, with good angiographic result. 5. Right L4 lumbar artery arteriogram demonstrates punctate foci of active extravasation. 6. Gel-Foam and coil embolization of the right L4 lumbar artery and post embolization arteriogram demonstrating stasis of the vessel, with good angiographic result. 7. Right external iliac artery arteriogram demonstrates the origin of the right lateral circumflex artery. 8. Right lateral circumflex artery arteriogram demonstrates proximity to the known area of bleeding, but without active extravasation. 9. Gel-Foam and coil embolization of the right lateral circumflex artery and post embolization arteriogram demonstrates stasis of the vessel, with good angiographic result. 10. Right internal iliac arteriogram demonstrates no active extravasation. IMPRESSION: 1. Punctate foci of active extravasation from the right L3 and L4 lumbar arteries, treated with Gelfoam and coil embolization, with good angiographic result. 2. The right lateral circumflex artery was in proximity to the known area of bleeding, and was Gel-Foam and coil embolized, with good angiographic result. 3. The previously identified right common femoral artery pseudoaneurysm remains thrombosed, with a tiny area (2-3 mm) of residual pseudoaneurysm, too small to treat. This will likely thrombose on its own. 4. A small 4 mm pseudoaneurysm identified arising from the left SFA on left CFA angiography at the site of the arterial pressure line entry was too small to treat, and appeared thrombosed with ultrasound at the conclusion of the case.

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 2 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 13 min during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 0.5 min, 9 mGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The right upper chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A 23cm tip-to-cuff length catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire through which the catheter was threaded into the right side of the heart with the tip in the right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures. Steri-strips were also used to close the venotomy incision site. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and both lumens were capped. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: Patent right internal jugular vein.

A preprocedure time-out was performed discussing the planned procedure, confirming the patients identity with 3 identifiers, and reviewing a checklist per  protocol. Under ultrasound guidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1 lidocaine was instilled for local anesthesia. A 22 gauge needle was advanced into the largest fluid pocket in the left lower quadrant and 30 cc of serosanguinous fluid was removed and sent to the laboratory. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication. Estimated blood loss was minimal. Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. IMPRESSION: Technically successful diagnostic paracentesis from the left lower quadrant with sample sent for microbiology, albumin, and cell count with differential. INDICATION:  year old man with RP bleed, on pressors  RP bleed COMPARISON: CTA dated . TECHNIQUE: OPERATORS: Dr.  and Dr.  radiologist performed the procedure. Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and has reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiology department. Please refer to anesthesiology notes for details. MEDICATIONS: 10 cc of 100 unitscc thrombin. CONTRAST: 95 ml of Optiray contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 11 min, 705 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Ultrasound and fluoroscopic guided placement of a right internal jugular central line. 2. Left common femoral artery access, ultrasound-guided. 3. Right external iliac arteriogram in multiple projections. 4. Ultrasound-guided thrombin injection into 2 pseudoaneurysms. 5. Post thrombin injection ultrasound of the right groin. 6. Post thrombin injection right external iliac arteriogram. 7. Left common femoral artery arteriogram. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patients son. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The right neck, and bilateral groins were prepped and draped in the typical sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a 19 gauge needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a J tipped wire was passed into the IVC using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for sequential dilators. A triple-lumen central venous catheter was advanced over the wire into the superior vena cava with the tip in the cavoatrial junction. All 3 access ports were aspirated, flushed and capped. An additional cap was placed on the swan port. The catheter was secured to the skin with a 0 silk suture and sterile dressings were applied. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. Using ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance, the left common femoral artery was punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid-femoral head. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after access, which confirmed patency. A 0.018 wire was passed easily into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was made over the needle. Then the inner dilator and wire were removed and  wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 5  sheath which was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm flush. A C2 Cobra catheter was placed over the aortic bifurcation, and a Glidewire was gently advanced into the right common femoral artery. The Cobra catheter was then advanced over the wire into the right external iliac artery. The wire was removed, and a contrast injection was performed to confirm positioning. A right external iliac arteriogram was then performed in the PA and  projections. Ultrasound evaluation of the right groin was then performed. A suitable location was identified to treat the pseudoaneurysm. Permanent ultrasound images were saved to PACs. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, a 20 gauge spinal needle was advanced into the peripheral aspect of the pseudoaneurysm. A contrast injection was performed to confirm position within the pseudoaneurysm, under fluoroscopy. Approximately 2.5 cc of 100 unitscc thrombin were carefully injected into the pseudoaneurysm, spaced out over 10 minutes, under continuous ultrasound guidance. Post thrombin injection ultrasound evaluation was performed, with images stored to PACs. After hemostasis was achieved in this pseudoaneurysm, ultrasound evaluation was performed of the pseudoaneurysm closer to the right common femoral artery. Permanent ultrasound images were saved to PACs. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, a 20 gauge needle was gently advanced into the peripheral aspect of the pseudoaneurysm. Approximately 8 cc of 100 unitscc thrombin was carefully injected into different portions of the pseudoaneurysm, spaced out over 10 minutes, under continuous ultrasound guidance, with care to avoid injection into the common femoral artery. Post thrombin injection ultrasound evaluation was performed, with images stored to PACs. Contrast injection was then performed through the C2 Cobra catheter to confirm positioning within the right external iliac artery. A right external iliac arteriogram was then performed in an  projection. Contrast was then injected into the left common femoral artery sheath, performing a left common femoral arteriogram. The left groin sheath was then removed, and hemostasis was achieved with an Angio-Seal device and manual compression. A sterile dressing VPad impregnated with thrombin was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure and there was no immediate complication. FINDINGS: 1. Ultrasound and fluoroscopic guided placement of a right internal jugular central line,  x 11 cm triple lumen trauma line. 2. Right external iliac arteriogram in multiple projections demonstrates large pseudoaneurysms arising from the right common femoral artery. A 3 cm pseudoaneurysm was present arising from the anterior surface of the right CFA immediately below the origin of the inferior epigastric artery with a narrow neck. This supplied a second more superior 3 cm pseudoaneurysm that demonstrated brisk active extravasation into the adjacent hematoma as seen on ultrasound and with contrast extravasation. 3. Sequential ultrasound-guided thrombin injection into both pseudoaneurysms (total 1050 units thrombin injected in 10.5 ml). 4. Post thrombin injection ultrasound of the right groin demonstrates no significant flow within the pseudoaneurysms. 5. Post thrombin injection right external iliac arteriogram demonstrates no residual flow in the pseudoaneurysms. 6. Left common femoral artery arteriogram demonstrates a relatively high bifurcation, but with appropriate access for Angio-Seal closure. IMPRESSION: 1. Active extravasation from pseudoaneurysms in the right groin, with large amounts of retroperitoneal hemorrhage. Successful ultrasound and fluoroscopic guided thrombin injection into the pseudoaneurysms, with occlusion of the pseudoaneurysms and good angiographic result upon completion. 2. Successful placement of a right internal jugular central line. The tip is in the lower SVC. The catheter is ready for immediate use.\n",

There are moderate bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left that have increased compared to the prior study. The heart size continues to be enlarged. The upper lungs are clear. INDICATION: Renal failure, intubated. COMPARISON: CXR . PORTABLE CHEST: The endotracheal tube has been slightly withdrawn, now positioned 3.8 cm above the carina. A right PIC catheter likely terminates within the brachiocephalic vein. Cardiomegaly is stable with atherosclerotic calcifications involving the aortic arch and descending aorta. Bilateral moderate pleural effusions and associated atelectasis are unchanged. There is no pneumothorax. IMPRESSION: 1. Satisfactory positioning of endotracheal tube. 2. Persistent moderate bilateral pleural effusions. HISTORY: Respiratory failure and sepsis. FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of , the tip of the right IJ catheter has been pulled back slightly. Bilateral pleural collections persist as does enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. Monitoring and support devices remain in place. The right subclavian catheter tip again lies outside of the hemithorax. PORTABLE CHEST ON  AT 08:31 INDICATION: MRSA pneumonia - check for change.  at 08:30. FINDINGS: Lines and tubes remain in place and compared to the prior study there is no significant interval change with consistent pleural collections and no new consolidations. REASON FOR EXAMINATION: Followup of the patient, intubated. Portable AP chest radiograph was compared to . The ET tube tip is 6 cm above the carina. The patient is rotated which prevents the precise evaluation of the right PICC line position, but it is most likely within the right subclavian vein. There are bilateral pleural effusion that appears to be slightly increased since the prior study. The position in the contours of the mediastinum cannot be evaluated due to significant rotation of the patient. INDICATION:  woman with right breast pain and lower extremity swelling. For evaluation of infiltrate or edema. . PA AND LATERAL CHEST: Marked cardiomegaly is new since . The aorta is tortuous and calcified. The lungs are clear without evidence of consolidation. Prominent vessels and Kerley B lines likely reflect mild CHF. Stable left pleural effusion or pleural thickening is unchanged since . Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine and rib deformities are similar to . IMPRESSION: Increase in heart size since , with mild CHF. INDICATION: New nasogastric tube placement. FINDINGS: Comparison is made to , 20:58. Nasogastric tube is in place, extending into the stomach, below the diaphragm and out of view. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is enlarged, unchanged. Bibasilar atelectasis, and layering pleural effusions are not significantly changed, allowing for differences in patient positioning. The overall degree of volume overload has not significantly changed. HISTORY:  female with extensive vaginal bleeding. COMPARISON: None available in the  PACS. PELVIC ULTRASOUND: Transabdominal ultrasound was performed. The uterus measures approximately 7.2 x 3.9 x 5.1 cm, enlarged for the patients age. Within the uterus, there is heterogeneous material representing a combination of vascularized soft tissue as well as possible blood products filling essentially the entire uterus, making delineation of the endometrium not possible by transabdominal technique. As the patient was unable to verbally consent transvaginal ultrasound, given dementia and previous CVAs, the patients daughter  was contacted, and did not wish to pursue transvaginal ultrasound at this time. IMPRESSION: Enlarged uterus with soft tissue and possiblly blood products suggests endometrial neoplasm. Although endometrial evaluation is superior with transvaginal technique, decision was made not to pursue at this time. Findings discussed with Dr.  after scan completion. HISTORY:  female with prior CVA, found unresponsive with supratherapeutic INR. Evaluate for CVA or trauma. COMPARISON: Non-contrast head CT . TECHNIQUE: Imaging was performed from the cranial vertex to the foramen magnum without IV contrast. HEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territorial infarction. Bone reconstructions demonstrate no fracture. A larger extent and more hyperdense appearance of a focal white matter hypodensity in the right lateral frontal lobe may represent evolution of prior ischemia seen in  (2:19). There is age-related parenchymal involutional change and moderate periventricular hyperdensity consistent with chronic small vessel ischemic change. Note is also made of calcified intracranial vessels including the vertebral and internal carotid arteries. Visualized paranasal sinuses and soft tissues appear unremarkable except for minimal left maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. IMPRESSION: 1. No hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. 2. More prominent appearance of right frontal white matter hypodensity since  may represent evolution of prior ischemia. 3.

The lungs are clear, the cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are unchanged with significant calcification of the ascending and descending aorta. The endotracheal tube ends 4.4 cm above the carina. IMPRESSION: Unchanged loculated large right pleural effusion and minimally enlarged moderate left pleural effusion. CHEST SINGLE VIEW ON  HISTORY: Intubated, question interval change. FINDINGS: The ET tube is 2.8 cm above the carina. Bilateral pleural effusions and moderate cardiomegaly are again seen. There is volume loss at both bases. An underlying infiltrate cannot be excluded. The upper lungs are clear. INDICATION:  with worsening dementia and positive for RPR. COMPARISONS: None. TECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1-weighted imaging was performed through the brain. Axial imaging was performed using T1, FLAIR, T2, gradient echo, FLAIR, and diffusion technique. Sagittal, coronal, and axial MP-RAGE imaging was also performed. FINDINGS: There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci consistent with age-related atrophy. The hippocampi maintain their normal architecture with mild atrophy corresponding with the degree of cerebral brain atrophy. Multiple foci of T2 hyperintensity within the right pericallosal white matter anteriorly and periventricular white matter are consistent with chronic infarcts. Small foci of increased T2 signal and decreased FLAIR signal intensity are present in the cerebellum consistent with remote lacunar infarcts. There is no evidence for mass effect, shift of the normally midline structures, or hydrocephalus. There are no areas of abnormal susceptibility suggest hemorrhage or diffusion abnormalities to suggest acute ischemia. There is a minimal amount of deep white matter T2 hyperintensity in the left basal ganglia and posterior periventricular regions likely representing chronic microangiopathic changes. The visualized orbits and major flow voids are normal. The imaged paranasal sinuses are clear. IMPRESSION: 1. Age-appropriate atrophy with no evidence for acute ischemia or other structural abnormality to explain the patients dementia. 2. Chronic infarctions along the right pericallosal and periventricular white matter. 3. Minimal changes of chronic microangiopathic disease. INDICATION:  woman with Foley for feeding tube. Please exchange for GJ tube. OPERATORS: Dr.  and Dr. , the attending radiologist, who was present and supervising throughout the entire procedure. ANESTHESIA: Patient is already intubated prior to coming down for procedure. Please note that this procedure immediately followed a temporary HD line placement. Please refer to the temporary HD line placement report of the same day. PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patients healthcare proxy, the patients daughter, informed consent was obtained over the telephone. The patient was subsequently placed supine on the angiographic table and the abdomen was prepped and draped in a usual sterile fashion. A pre-procedure timeout was performed with patient identifiers times three. Initial fluoroscopic image of the abdomen demonstrated the presence of a previously placed Foley catheter tube into the stomach. Injection of approximately  cc of Optiray intravenous contrast through the catheter confirmed its position with its tip in the antrum of the stomach without evidence of extravasation or obstruction. Next, a 0.035 Glidewire was passed through the existing Foley catheter and brought out with the distal tip of the wire in the region of the pylorus. The Foley catheter was removed and replaced with a sheath. A number of different catheter shpes were then placed over the Glidewire and attempts made to pass through the pylorus into the dudenum . Ultimately, with the help of Dr.  and Sos catheter were manipulted through the pylorus, duodenum and into the jejunum. An Ampltz wire was then advanced through the catheter. A  peel- away sheath was then placed over the Amplatz wire and the tip placed in the proximal dudenum. A 14   gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed over the Amplatz wire through the peel-away sheath and advanced into the jejunum. The Amplatz wire and peel- away sheath were then removed. The final position of the gastrojejunostomy catheter is in the proximal jejunum, which was confirmed by contrast injection through the catheter. The catheter was then locked by forming a loop inside the proximal duodenum and the loop was locked. The catheter was then secured to the skin with an ostomy dressing and a sterile dressing was then applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: Exchange of Foley catheter as G-tube with a  gastrojejunostomy catheter with the tip of the catheter located in the proximal jejunum. CHEST, SINGLE VIEW HISTORY: Stroke, elevated white count. REFERENCE EXAM: . FINDINGS: The heart continues to be moderate to severely enlarged. There continues to be ill definition of the right heart border, and it is unclear if there could be some volume lossinfiltrate in that region. However, this is similar in appearance compared to recent examinations. There is a small left pleural effusion. There are no new pulmonary findings. CHEST RADIOGRAPH INDICATION: Renal failure, pulmonary opacities, evaluation for interval change. COMPARISON: . FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant change.

TECHNIQUE: Fluoroscopy was performed confirming partial withdrawal of the gastrojejunostomy tube with the locking loop now located within the stomach. The tube was pushed back into the stomach slightly forming the locking loop. The tip of the catheter in the proximal jejunum. IMPRESSION: Adjustment of the position of the gastrojejunostomy catheter with the tip of the feeding tube located in the proximal jejunum and locking mechanism loop in the stomach. PICC LINE EXCHANGE  REPOSITIONING INDICATION: Malposition of indwelling PICC line. The procedure was explained to the patient. A timeout was performed. RADIOLOGIST: Dr.  and Dr.  performed the procedure. Dr, , the Attending Radiologist, was present and supervised the entire porcedure. TECHNIQUE: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, a guidewire was advanced through the indwelling right arm PICC line, and subsequently into the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. The old PICC line was then removed and a peel-away sheath was then placed over the guidewire. A new double lumen PICC line measuring 37 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated fluoroscopically guided PICC line exchange for a new  double lumen PICC line. Final internal length is 37 cm, with the tip positioned in the SVC. The line is ready to use. HISTORY: Intubation, to evaluate for change. FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of , the right subclavian catheter has been somewhat repositioned, most likely in the right brachiocephalic region with the tip heading towards the superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube tip is unchanged. There is stable cardiomegaly and bilateral pleural effusions. ULTRASOUND KIDNEYS INDICATION: Acute renal failure. Possible AVN. Rule out obstruction. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Both kidneys are small in length, the right kidney measuring 8.8 cm in length and the left kidney measuring 9.6 cm in length. The cortex of both kidneys is abnormally increased in echogenicity. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis or focal mass. There is mild-to-moderate ascites. There is a Foley catheter in the bladder. Of note, there is a cuff of echogenic material about the balloon of the Foley catheter. This may represent debris adherent to the Foley catheter balloon. IMPRESSION: 1. Small echogenic kidneys bilaterally. 2. No evidence of hydronephrosis. 3. Echogenic material surrounds the Foley catheter balloon, likely representing adherent debris. Report discussed with the patients nurse, , at 1:30 p.m. on . CHEST RADIOGRAPH INDICATION: Evaluation for interval change, history of respiratory failure. COMPARISON: . FINDINGS: As compared to the previous examination, the endotracheal tube is in unchanged position. Unchanged bilateral pleural effusions, unchanged cardiomegaly. No evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia. No evidence of pneumothorax. AP CHEST, 10:10 A.M.,  HISTORY: Patient intubated with a new central line. Atrial fibrillation. New right internal jugular dual-channel central venous line ends at the superior cavoatrial junction. Moderate bilateral pleural effusion unchanged. Overlying devices obscure the left upper lobe, but there is probably more venous congestion today than yesterday. Large cardiac silhouette is stable, and mediastinal veins remain engorged. ET tube in standard placement. HISTORY: Respiratory failure, for ET tube placement. FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, the endotracheal tube is approximately 5 cm above the carina. Bilateral pleural effusions are again seen and the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and engorgement of the mediastinal veins is stable. Little change in the other monitoring and support devices. CLINICAL INFORMATION: The patient is an  woman with stroke and dysphagia. A request was made to place a GJ tube for feeding. OPERATORS: Dr. , Dr. , Dr.  and Dr. , the attending radiologist who was present and supervised during the whole procedure. PROCEDURE: Gastrojejunostomy catheter placement. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of total of 75 mcg of fentanyl and 0.5 mg of Versed throughout the total intra- service time of 15 minutes during which the patients hemodynamics parameters were continuously monitored. Lidocaine was used for local anesthesia. PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as conscious sedation were explained, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the angiographic suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. The gastric lumen was inflated by air infusion through the existing OG tube. Three T-fasteners were deployed to secure the abdominal wall to the gastric wall, and the location of the T-fasteners were confirmed by aspiration and contrast infusion through the needles while the needles were advanced into the gastric lumen through the abdominal wall. A 19-gauge needle was then used to puncture into the gastric lumen at the  the three T-fasteners under fluoroscopic guidance. The tip of the needle was located inside the gastric lumen which was confirmed by an aspiration and a contrast injection. A 0.035 J-wire was then placed over the needle into the gastric lumen. A small incision was made over the needle and the needle was then removed. A 5   tip sheath was then placed over the J-wire into the gastric lumen. The J-wire and inner stiffener of the sheath was then removed. A 5  catheter was then placed through the sheath into the gastric lumen and was further advanced into the proximal duodenum with the help of a 0.035 stiff glidewire. The glidewire was then removed and placed over the 0.035  wire. The  wire and the Kumpe catheter were then further advanced into the proximal jejunum. The  wire was then removed and replaced with a 0.035 super stiff Amplatz wire with the tip of the Amplatz wire terminated inside the proximal jejunum. The sheath and the Kumpe catheter were then removed over the wire. A telescope peelaway sheath from a 12  introducer set was then placed over the Amplatz wire into the gastric lumen and the inner stiffness of the sheath was then removed. A 14   gastrojejunostomy catheter was then placed over the Amplatz wire through the peelaway sheath into the gastric lumen and further advanced into the jejunum. The Amplatz wire was then removed, and the peelaway sheath was then peeled away. The final position of the tip of the gastrojejunostomy catheter was in the proximal jejunum which was confirmed by contrast infusion through the catheter. The catheter was then locked by forming a loop inside the proximal duodenum and the loop was locked. Catheter was then sutured to skin and a sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: Placement of gastrojejunostomy catheter with the tip of the catheter located at proximal jejunum and the catheter is ready to use. HISTORY: Frank bloody secretions, to evaluate for hemorrhage. FINDINGS: In comparison with the earlier study of this date, there is little change in the enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, bilateral pleural effusions, and position of the moderate fraying of support devices. There is an area of ill-defined opacification in the left perihilar region. The possibility of an area of air space consolidation, representing either hemorrhage or aspiration, should be considered in view of the clinical history. CHEST X-RAY DATED . HISTORY:  female status post fall with bradycardia. COMPARISON: . FINDINGS: PA and lateral views of the chest were obtained. The heart is stably enlarged. There is atherosclerotic disease of the aorta, which is tortuous in appearance. There are small bilateral pleural effusions with cephalization of the pulmonary vessels, more prominent on the left. Also noted is minimal left lower lobe atelectasis. The osseous structures are intact with no displaced rib fractures identified. The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized with a prominent kyphosis within the thoracic spine. IMPRESSION: Stable cardiomegaly with mild volume overload and small bilateral pleural effusions. INDICATION:  woman with right sided weakness, last seen normal at 7:30 p.m. Rule out bleed. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain. No contrast was administered. FINDINGS: There is no intracranial hemorrhage, edema, shift of normally midline structures. There is a focal region of white matter hypodensity with loss of gray-white differentiation of the overlying cortex in the right lateral frontal lobe (2:17, 18). However, there is no associated sulcal effacement or edema in this area. This may reflect chronic changes rather than acute infarct. No other areas suggesting vascular territorial infarct are identified. Ventricles and sulci demonstrate mild age related involution and are otherwise within normal limits. The gray-white differentiation is otherwise preserved. The basilar cisterns are symmetric. The paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. There is no fracture. Soft tissues are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. No intracranial hemorrhage. 2. Focal hypodensity in the right lateral frontal cortex, with small region of loss of gray-white differentiation, without edema or sulcal effacement. This may reflect chronic change or prior infarct rather than acute infarct. MRI is recommended to evaluate for acute ischemia. MRI AND MRA OF THE HEAD DONE ON  CLINICAL INDICATION:  female with right-sided weakness. TECHNIQUE: MR examination of the head including sagittal T1, axial T1, T2, gradient echo, FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging and MRA exam of the head with MIP images are obtained. COMPARISON: Comparison is made with the prior study of . SCAN FINDINGS: This study is moderately limited secondary to excessive motion artifact. There are periventricular and subcortical T2 hyperintensities consistent with small vessel ischemic changes. There is a focal area of increased FLAIR signal with associated slow diffusion in the superior right temporal lobe. This area involves the cortex and is consistent with a small subacute cortical infarct. There is an additional tiny focus of slow diffusion in the left posterior parietal cortex without FLAIR abnormality which may represent an additional tiny infarct. The pattern is suggestive of embolic infarcts. There is susceptibility artifact within the left putamen consistent with likely old blood products. The ventricles are normal in size. MRA HEAD: MRA of the head is limited secondary to motion. However, the bilateral intracranial internal carotid arteries, MCAs, ACAs, and PCAs are patent. No major vessel occlusion is seen. Sensitivity for branch occlusion will be extremely low due to motion artifact. The basilar artery is patent. The right vertebral artery is hypoplastic. MRA NECK: The bilateral common and internal carotid arteries are patent. The bifurcation is patent bilaterally. The left vertebral artery is dominant. IMPRESSION: 1. Small right temporal subacute cortical infarct. 2. Tiny additional likely left parietal cortical infarct. 3. Limited MRA head demonstrates no significant abnormality. HISTORY: Stroke, preoperative for G-tube placement. FINDINGS: In comparison with study of , there is little change. Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with small bilateral pleural effusions and possible bibasilar atelectasis. The nasogastric tube extends to the upper stomach. The side hole was not seen, but probably lies above the esophagogastric junction. HISTORY:  woman with vaginal and rectal bleeding. Pelvic ultrasound concerning for endometrial carcinoma. COMPARISON: Pelvic ultrasound, . TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired of the pelvis on a 3 Tesla magnet without IV gadolinium. FINDINGS: There is an intracavitary endometrial mass, correlating to the finding on the recent ultrasound. The mass measures approximately 2.7 x 2.0 x 2.4 cm. While evaluation is significantly limited by patient motion artifact, the mass appears to be limited to the endometrium without definite myometrial or extrauterine involvement. The inferior margin of the mass abuts the internal cervical os, but there is no definite evidence of cervical invasion. There is a small amount of endometrial fluid. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is identified. There is no free intraperitoneal pelvic fluid. The bladder is decompressed by a Foley catheter. The rectum is distended with gas. No definite rectal mass is seen. Pelvic loops of bowel are somewhat obscured by motion artifact but no definite abnormality is identified. Edema is noted of the soft tissues of the buttocks, probably from prolonged supine positioning. There are small bilateral hip joint effusions, but no concerning bone marrow signal abnormality. IMPRESSION: Endometrial mass concerning for carcinoma. While evaluation by MR is significantly limited due to motion artifact, the mass appears confined to the endometrium without definite myometrial, extrauterine or cervical involvement. Thus this is suspected to be a T1b lesion. Dr.  provided a wet reading of these findings to Dr.   who was covering for referring physician,  on . PROCEDURE: CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis without contrast. REASON FOR EXAM: Evaluate for pneumonia or ischemic gut. TECHNIQUE: MDCT chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed without IV contrast. 5-mm axial sequences were acquired with coronal and sagittal reformats. COMPARISON: No previous CT was available for comparison. CT CHEST: There are large bilateral pleural effusions with associated compressive atelectasis. No consolidation or pneumothorax. The patient is intubated and the endotracheal tube tip is satisfactory at the thoracic inlet. Airways are widely patent to segmental level, although evaluation is limited by respiratory motion artifact. The proximal esophagus is distended and contains an air-fluid level. Caliber of the aorta is normal with diffuse atherosclerotic-type calcification, calcification of the aortic valve, mitral valve, and diffuse calcification is seen throughout the coronary arteries. Mild dilatation of the main and right pulmonary arteries to 35 mm suggests mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. No pericardial effusion, moderate cardiomegaly. Focal pleural thickening associated with calcification suggests prior asbestos exposure. CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH ORAL CONTRAST ONLY: Limited evaluation of the liver and spleen do not reveal any intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. A small area of calcification in the periphery of the right lobe (2.71) is a calcified granuloma. The kidneys are unremarkable except to note slightly irregular cortices suggesting scarring and small cortical calcifications. No hydronephrosis. There is free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis. No bowel dilatation, wall thickening, pneumotosis, or free air. The oral contrast passes distally to the rectum. Gastrostomy tube and urinary catheter are satisfactory with air in the bladder. A left femoral line tip ends at the distal external iliac vein. There is diffuse calcification throughout the aorta and iliac arteries. The soft tissues are markedly edematous with anasarca. Review of the bones shows moderately-severe degenerative changes throughout the thoracic spine and facet joints in the lower lumbar spine with a small bone island in the right iliac crest and old fracture of the left inferior pubic ramus. IMPRESSION: Large bilateral pleural effusions with bilateral lower lobe compressive atelectasis. No consolidation or pneumothorax. Diffuse intra-abdominal free fluid. No bowel dilatation, pneumatosis, or intra-abdominal free air to suggest bowel ischemia. Diffuse aortic valvular, mitral annulus, and coronary artery calcification with moderate cardiomegaly and probable mild pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pleural calcification and thickening suggests prior asbestos exposure. Thoracolumbar degenerative changes with facet joint disease in the lower lumbar and lumbosacral spine, benign right iliac bone island, and healed left inferior pubic ramus fracture of unknown chronicity. Satisfactory position of left femoral venous line, endotracheal tube, urinary catheter, and gastrostomy tube. INDICATION:  woman with renal failure and volume overload. Plan to initiate hemodialysis. Please place temporary hemodialysis line. OPERATORS: Dr.  Dr. , the attending radiologist who was present for the entire procedure. ANESTHESIA: Patient was intubated prior to being brought down for the procedure. In addition, local anesthesia was provided with 1 buffered lidocaine. The patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored throughout. The total intra-service time was 1 hour and 25 minutes. This included a second procedure of GJ tube exchange, which immediately followed this temporary HD line placement. Please refer to the GJ tube exchange report of the same day. PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: The risks and benefits of the procedure were explained to the patients healthcare proxy, her daughter, and informed consent was obtained over the telephone prior to the procedure. Subsequently, the patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A preprocedural timeout was performed. Under ultrasound guidance, with hard copy images saved, under fluoroscopic guidance, the right internal jugular vein was accessed with a micropuncture needle. A guidewire was then passed into the SVC and the needle exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The wire was then exchanged for  wire, which was then advanced into the IVC. The sheath was then removed and serial dilations were performed over the  wire. Ultimately, a 14 , 20 cm long double-lumen central venous catheter was placed over the guidewire with the tip terminating within the right atrium. The wire was then removed and both ports were aspirated and flushed easily. The catheter was secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures and a sterile dressing was applied. There is a final spot fluoroscopic radiograph demonstrating satisfactory placement of the catheter, with the tip terminating within the right atrium. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: Uncomplicated successful placement of double-lumen central venous catheter with tip terminating within the right atrium. The line was flushed and ready to use. AP CHEST, 6:21 P.M. ON : HISTORY: Acute desaturation, suspect mucous plug, pneumonia or pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to , 3:30 p.m.: Lung volumes have improved, small bilateral pleural effusions have decreased, there is no pulmonary consolidation or edema. Severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Nasogastric tube ends in the distal stomach. PORTABLE CHEST  CLINICAL INFORMATION: PICC placement. FINDINGS: Right PICC has been placed and the tip terminates in a branch coming off the axillary vein, possibly long thoracic. The tip does not appear to terminate in the subclavian vein. Pullback and repositioning is suggested. The heart is markedly enlarged. There is continued consolidation of the left lower lobe as well as right middle lobe and lingula. Upper lungs are clear. Aorta is calcified. IMPRESSION: 1. Right PICC terminates in a small branch arising from the axillary or subclavian vein. Pullback and repositioning is recommended. 2. Remainder of the chest is unchanged. INDICATION:  female status post unwitnessed fall. COMPARISON: None. TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast axial images of the cervical spine are obtained with multiplanar reformatted images. FINDINGS: There is no acute fracture or alignment abnormality. The atlantoaxial and occipital articulations are maintained. Vertebral body heights are maintained and there is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling. There is patchy osteopenia and multilevel cervical spondylosis with disc height narrowing noted, most prominent from C34 through C56. Prominent posterior disc osteophyte complexes at C56 and C67 cause mild central canal narrowing. Bilateral neural facet narrowing by osteophytosis is most prominent at C45 and C56. Mild emphysematous changes are noted at the lung apices. Multiple thyroid nodules are noted bilaterally. Atherosclerotic calcifications involve the common carotid bifurcation. IMPRESSION: Cervical spondylosis without fracture or acute alignment abnormality. HISTORY: GI bleed, found unresponsive. FINDINGS: In comparison with study of , there is little overall change. Large right and moderate left pleural effusions again seen. Cardiac silhouette appears more prominent and there is continued elevation of pulmonary venous pressure. Large azygos vein region suggests some right heart failure. Endotracheal tube tip lies well above the carina. The left perihilar opacification is less prominent. This could reflect clearing of aspiration or hemorrhage. AP CHEST 1:16 P.M. ON : HISTORY:  intubated patient. Question interval change. IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to : Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions have increased. Left lower lobe is severely atelectatic. There may be new pulmonary edema in the perihilar distribution in the left lung. Large heart is obscured by adjacent pleural effusion. ET tube in standard placement. Thoracic aorta is markedly tortuous and heavily calcified. Dr.  was paged. HISTORY:  female with G- tube that fell out. A Foley placed in the G-tube access and contrast injected. Evaluate position. COMPARISON: Abdominal radiographs . TWO VIEWS OF THE ABDOMEN: Contrast injected through the catheter is seen filling loops of jejunum. The foley balloon is visualized in the right mid- abdomen. There is no obvious extravasation of contrast. Note is made of abundant vascular calcification. The bowel gas pattern is non- obstructive. IMPRESSION: Foley within jejunum with contrast filling jejunal loops.\n",

      "CLINICAL INFORMATION:  man with alcoholic cirrhosis and HCC being treated with CyberKnife. He was incidentally noted to have splenic artery aneurysms on prior CT scan. Request is made for splenic arteriogram with possible embolization of the aneurysms. COMPARISON: CT abdomen with contrast from . FELLOW: . RESIDENT: . STAFF RADIOLOGIST: , who supervised procedure. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of a total of 125 mcg of fentanyl and 6 mg of Versed throughout the total intraservice time of 4 hours 55 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored. 1 lidocaine was used for local anesthesia. PROCEDURES: 1. Celiac axis arteriogram. 2. Splenic arteriogram. 3. No intervention performed. CONTRAST: Approximately 280 cc of Optiray. PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS: After review of the risks and benefits of the procedure as well as conscious sedation, informed consent was obtained. The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Access was obtained under ultrasound guidance with a micropuncture needle into the common femoral artery. A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle into the abdominal aorta. The needle was removed and replaced with a micropuncture sheath, which was used to upsized the wire to  wire. The micropuncture sheath was removed and replaced with a 5  vascular sheath, which was attached to a sidearm suction. Initially, a C2 catheter was used to select the celiac axis. An arteriogram was performed, which demonstrated the splenic artery, and the common hepatic artery and its branches. A small aneurysm was seen at the origin of the common hepatic artery, which is better seen on prior CT angiography. Subsequently, the C2 catheter was exchanged for  catheter, which was used to select the celiac trunk. A celiac angiogam was performed with 3D reconstructions which were performed by Dr  on A dedicated 3D workstation. This demonstrated an extremely tortuous, large diameter splenic artery. Two splenic artery aneurysms were seen. The first measures 3.0 x 1.4 cm, and the second more distal aneurysm measures 1.6 x 1.9 cm. A Renegade STS microcatheter and 016 Fathom microwire were placed through the  catheter and advanced across the larger more proximal aneurysm. However, when attempting to exchange for a stiffer wire, access was lost. Numerous catheters and wires were used to attempt to cross the larger more proximal aneurysm with a stiffener wire to enable stenting or coiling. These included a C2 Glide catheter, and angled-tapered Glide catheter, a Glidewire, and a stiff Glidewire. However, these attempts ultimately proved unsuccessful. Access to the neck of the aneurysm was obtained with a 4  angled-tapered Glide catheter and distal to the aneurysm access was obtained with the Renegade STS microcather and V18 control wire. However despite being able to gain access distal the aneurysm with a microwire and catheter we were unable to advance the 4  glide catheter beyond the aneurysm and as a result a wire stiff enough to allow stenting could not be placed. The neck of the aneurysm was a least 2 cm wide and would not allow safe coiling of the aneuysm without significant risk of occluding the splenic artery. AS a result the decision was made to terminate the procedure. The catheters and wires were removed. Through the sidearm of the sheath, contrast was injected to demonstrate that the bifurcation of the common femoral artery was approximately 4 cm below the access site. As such, Angio- Seal device was used for closure. There were no immediate complications. IMPRESSION: 1. Celiac axis arteriogram and splenic arteriogram demonstrating a small aneurysm at the origin of the common hepatic artery, and two splenic artery aneurysms measuring 3.0 x 1.4 cm and 1.6 x 1.9 cm, respectively. 2. Unsuccessful attempts at crossing the larger more proximal aneurysm with a stiff wire to enable stent assisted coiling of the aneurysm. Coil embolization of the aneurysm was not performed due to the wide neck of the aneurysm and resulting high risk of splenic artery occlusion. 3. If the patients aneurysm increases significantly in size or becomes symptomatic embolization of the splenic artery proximal and distal to the aneurysm could be performed. Ultrasound guidance for radiofrequency ablation. Please refer to combined report under clip  for full details. INDICATION:  male with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, here to evaluate for evidence of disease progression. COMPARISON: CT chest without contrast, last performed on  and CT of the abdomen with and without contrast, last performed on . No prior studies of the pelvis are available for comparison. TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained of the abdomen prior to and following the administration of intravenous contrast and oral contrast in the arterial, portal venous, and three-minute delayed phases. MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in the portal venous phase. Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were generated and reviewed. FINDINGS: CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: The thyroid gland is incompletely visualized with a 7-mm hypodensity in the right lobe (3B:72). No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are identified in the supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar regions. The pulmonary arterial trunk is patent and normal in caliber. The thoracic aorta is also normal in caliber without evidence of acute aortic syndrome. There is a normal three-vessel takeoff from the aortic arch. The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. Calcifications of the coronary arteries and mitral valve annulus are noted. The central tracheobronchial tree is patent to the subsegmental levels. A pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe measuring 7 mm has increased in size from  (previously 4 mm) on image 136, series 3B. A smaller peripheral nodule in the right middle lobe measuring 3-4 mm in size is unchanged (3B:155). No other pulmonary nodules are detected. A few calcified granulomas in the left lung are unchanged. The lungs are otherwise clear without focal consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax. CT ABDOMEN: The liver is shrunken with a cirrhotic configuration. The patient is status post Cyberknife therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in segment V of the liver, now measuring 4.1 x 4.1 x 3.6 cm (previously 4.3 x 3.7 cm) on image 178, series 3B. This lesion is unchanged in appearance with peripheral arterial enhancement and iso-enhancement on delayed imaging with a central hypodense area. The patient is status post RFA of hepatocellular carcinoma in segment VIII of the liver with fiducial markers at the site. This lesion now measures 4.5 x 3.4 x 3.3 cm (previously 6.8 x 4.3 cm) on image 32, series 3A. This lesion shows peripheral arterial enhancement that demonstrates iso-enhancement on delayed imaging, also seen on the prior CT. However, there are three adjacent arterially enhancing lesions not clearly seen on the prior study of . An area of peripheral nodular arterial enhancement in the high dome of the liver (3A:22) measures approximately 15 x 8 mm. An 11-mm arterially enhancing lesion lateral to the segment VII lesion (3A:29) and a 13-mm arterially enhancing lesion medially (3A:33) are also noted. The previously described arterial enhancing focus in segment VII of the liver is not seen on todays examination. Another in segment VIVII is slightly increased in size measuring 14 x 12 mm (previously 11 x 10 mm) on image 44, series 3A. There is residual portal venous thrombus in the main portal vein which is improved from  as it no longer extends to the portosplenic confluence. Cavernous transformation is unchanged. Lesions previously characterized as arterial aneurysms in the celiac, splenic, and hepatic arteries are thought to represent tortuous vessels. There is a pathologically enlarged paracaval lymph node measuring 3.2 x 2.2 cm (3B:193) which is increased in size from  (previously 1.3 x 1.2 cm). Several small celiac nodes do not meet CT size criteria for lymphadenopathy. A pathologically enlarged lymph node is also seen in the distal aortocaval region measuring 3.2 x 2.7 cm (3B:222). The spleen is enlarged measuring 21 cm in size with large splenic varices and splenorenal shunting. There are associated tortuous and dilated collateral vessels including gastric, esophageal, and periumbilical varices. The bilateral adrenal glands and kidneys are unremarkable. A sub-5-mm left renal cortical hypodensity is too small to fully characterize by CT but likely represents a renal cyst. The stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable without evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. The appendix is normal. No free air or ascites is present. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber throughout. CT PELVIS: Evaluation of pelvic contents is limited due to metallic streak artifact from right hip hardware. Within these limitations, the prostate, seminal vesicles, urinary bladder, and rectum are unremarkable. The sigmoid colon contains numerous diverticula without inflammatory changes. There is no free fluid within the pelvis, and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is seen. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The patient is status post total hip arthroplasty on the right. Wedge compression fracture deformity at the T8 vertebral body is unchanged. Superior endplate anterior depression of the L1 vertebral body is unchanged from . There is complete loss of intervertebral disc space at the L5-S1 level with endplate sclerosis and osteophytosis which may be degenerative in etiology. There are new healing rib fractures involving the left lateral seventh through tenth ribs from the prior CT chest of . Multiple healed rib fractures are noted bilaterally. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are detected. IMPRESSION: 1. Evidence of disease progression with arterially enhancing lesions adjacent to the treated hepatocellular carcinoma in segment VIII, pathologically enlarged paracaval and aortocaval lymph nodes, and increased size of pulmonary nodule compared to the prior CT of . 2. Persistent peripheral enhancement of the treated hepatocellular carcinoma in segment V concerning for residual disease, unchanged in appearance from . 3.

COMPARISON: Multiple prior CTs, most recently . FINDINGS: Calcification is noted on the mitral valve. The cardiac apex is otherwise normal. The lung bases are clear. CyberKnife seeds are again seen in the right lobe of the liver and are unchanged compared to prior. The previously seen lesion in segment V of the liver is more prominent compared to prior. It demonstrates arterial enhancement with washout on the portal venous phase, consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. A second new intrahepatic lesion is seen in segment VIII of the liver. It enhances peripherally on arterial phase with incomplete washout on the portal venous phase. Differential diagnosis for this lesion includes vascular shunt versus hepatocellular carcinoma. The spleen is still enlarged, slightly larger compared to prior. It is now 18.7 cm (previously 18.1 cm). The gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, adrenal glands, and visualized portions of small and large bowel are normal. The previously seen arterial aneurysm at the bifurcation of the celiac artery is stable measuring 23 mm (previously 23 mm). The dilatation of the common hepatic artery seen previously is stable measuring 10 mm (previously 10 mm). The previously seen splenic artery aneurysm formerly measured 23 mm, now measures 25 mm and contains a thrombus, which is new. The portal vein is diminutive with cavernous transformation. The previously seen dilated left retroperitoneal venous collateral contains a new thrombus (5:102). Again seen are venous collaterals including a splenorenal shunt. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. Osseous structures are unremarkable. Mild degenerative disease is noted in the spine. IMPRESSION: 1. Increased prominence of previously seen lesion in segment VIII of the liver and new lesion noted in segment V, which may represent hepatocellular carcinoma vs vascular shunt, thus attention on fu. 2.

COMPARISON: There are no previous CT images for comparison. FINDINGS: The lung bases are clear with some minimal atelectatic changes, and no obvious pulmonary nodules. There is no pleural effusion. The kidneys enhancing in normal and symmetric fashion with symmetric excretion. The adrenals are within normal limits. The pancreas appears small but within normal limits. There is a hypodense focus in the spleen, 3A:33, measuring 9 mm and too small to characterize. There are two enhancing lesions in the liver, 3A:26, measuring 30 x 23 mm, right liver lobe; and 3A:36, 20 x 15 mm, right liver lobe, concerning for hepatocellular carcinoma. The gallbladder is within normal limits. There is no pathologic abdominal lymphadenopathy, ascites, or pneumoperitoneum. No abnormally thickened or dilated abdominal bowel loops. There are scattered diverticula in the colon, with no evidence of diverticulitis. There are scattered small lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum and mesentery, not meeting the CT criteria for pathological enlargement.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen before and after administration of IV Optiray contrast. Three-minute delayed images were obtained through the abdomen. Coronal and sagittal reformations were displayed and essential in delineating the anatomy and pathology. CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: Lung bases are clear without focal opacity, mass or pleural effusion. The liver demonstrates diffuse fatty infiltration with a nodular contour and shrunken appearance. Again noted is an ill-defined 1.4 x 1.0 cm lesion just adjacent to the right side of the gallbladder demonstrating delayed and persistent enhancement without washout. This lesion corresponds to the previously seen lesion on  and may represent residual tumor. CyberKnife seeds are again noted in segments VIII and VVI of the liver. assessment of enhancement in the area of the fiducial seeds is difficult due to streak artifact. No new hepatic lesions are identified. The spleen measures up to 18.3 cm. There are extensive perisplenic varices and splenorenal shunt with a massive gonadal vein on the left. The previously seen 2.0 cm splenic artery aneurysm is now partially thrombosed. A 1.7 cm aneurysm of the celiac trunk bifurcation is unchanged.

The visualized osseous and soft tissue structures are within normal limits. The trachea and mediastinum are midline. The cardiac silhouette is not enlarged. There is no pulmonary infiltrate or vascular congestion. There is no pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: Normal exam. INDICATION:  man with hepatocellular carcinoma with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Evaluate for portal vein thrombosis. COMPARISON: Non-contrast CT , ultrasound , . FINDINGS: The study is limited by patient difficulty with cooperation and portable technique. The liver is slightly echogenic and heterogeneous, consistent with known cirrhosis. The known RFA site is not seen on this limited study. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The common duct is not dilated measuring 4 mm. The gallbladder is only partially visualized, but no shadowing stones are seen. The pancreas is not seen due to overlying bowel gas. The spleen is markedly enlarged and not able to be measured on this study. The right kidney is 13.5 cm and the left kidney is 13.9 cm. Single views of each kidney show no hydronephrosis.

CHEST CT ON  HISTORY: Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Dyspnea. Evaluate pulmonary nodules. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without indication for intravenous contrast agent reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial and 5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal images compared to CT scanning of the chest,  and , and partial imaging of the chest on interventional CT scans of the abdomen,  and . FINDINGS: Multiple small lung nodules have developed since , punctate lesions in the left upper lobe, 3:12, 7-mm right lower lobe nodule, 3:32, punctate lesion in the right middle lobe, 3:35, 9-mm wide cluster of small nodules in the left upper lobe, 4:87, 3-mm subpleural nodules left lower lobe, 4:110, 122, 173, and a cluster of nodules, 8 mm in aggregate in the right middle lobe, 4:145. There is also a widespread relatively mild multifocal peribronchial abnormality, presumably infection, predominantly in the left lung, which could explain a 4-mm left upper lobe nodule, 4:51, as well as some of the previously described left upper lobe nodules and a region of quite nodular peribronchial infiltration in the lingula, . An 11-mm wide subpleural lesion deep in the left lateral pleural sulcus, 4:192, could be a soft tissue nodule or atelectasis. 7-mm central lymph nodes are numerous but not pathologically enlarged by size criteria ranging up to 7 mm in the prevascular station, 2:22, probably unchanged since , and 11 mm in the subcarinal and paraesophageal stations, , also essentially unchanged. Atherosclerotic calcification is present in the left anterior descending and to a minimal degree in the right main coronary artery, both unchanged. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. A right-sided central venous line ends low in the SVC. This study is not designed for subdiaphragmatic diagnosis but shows no adrenal mass, stable moderate-to-severe splenomegaly. Mild compression of the upper endplates of two thoracic vertebral bodies, probably T3 and T8, is new since , but does not look pathologic. IMPRESSION: 1. Even if the majority of multiple subcentimeter pulmonary nodules new since , are due to the bronchial inflammation or infection seen in the left lung, there is still a sufficient number of nodules in areas free of inflammation, to raise concern for metastasis from reported hepatocellular carcinoma. The lesions are too small to promise differentiation of malignancy from infection by PET scanning. Depending upon clinical circumstances, surveillance may be the most reasonable approach, with a repeat scan in no more than three months. 2. Mild, non-pathologic thoracic vertebral compression fractures, new since . PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY INDICATION: Patient intubated, new right jugular placement. COMPARISON: . FINDINGS: ET tube is 3 cm above carina. New right jugular line ends at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. Pulmonary vessel engorgement has slightly increased in this patient with biventricular decompensation. Mild pulmonary edema is stable. Pleural effusion is small if any. There is no pneumothorax. Mild enlarged cardiac contour and dilatation of azygous vein is unchanged. CONCLUSION: 1. New jugular line is in adequate position. There is no pneumothorax. 2. Pulmonary vessels dilatation has slightly worsened with no increase of mild pulmonary edema. INDICATION:  man with cirrhosis and  status post CyberKnife treatment. COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen . TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the abdomen were acquired using the triphasic liver protocol. Images were acquired in the non-contrast, arterial phase, portal phase and delayed phases. Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated and reviewed. FINDINGS: The visualized lung bases are unremarkable without suspicious pulmonary nodules or pleural effusions. The visualized portion of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable except for atherosclerotic calcification of the coronary arteries. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: CyberKnife seeds are present in the right lobe of liver, unchanged in position since the prior study. The previously described lesion in segment VIII is not seen on the current study. Arterially hyperenhancing lesion in segment V (3A:35) is now seen measuring 14 x 14 mm and similar in size to the prior study . No new liver lesions are identified.

COMPARISON: No similar study at . FINDINGS: Limited examination was performed of the four abdominal quadrants and midline which demonstrates no ascites. IMPRESSION: No abdominal ascites is demonstrated. INDICATION: History of HCC, status post CyberKnife and RFA. Re-staging. COMPARISON: CT abdomen from . CT abdomen from . TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the iliac crests without administration of oral or intravenous contrast material. Subsequently, rapid axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the iliac crests during infusion of intravenous contrast material. Arterial, portal venous, and three-minute delayed phase series were acquired. Multiplanar reformations were performed. FINDINGS: The visualized portions of the lung bases are unremarkable. Coronary artery calcifications are noted. The patient is status post right hepatic lobe CyberKnife therapy and radio-frequency ablation for multifocal HCC. Within the segment V radio-frequency ablation treatment zone, there is a 3.1 x 2.9 cm lesion (previously 2.2 x 1.9 cm) with arterial phase nodularrim enhancement that becomes isointense to the liver parenchyma on delayed phase imaging (4:33). Centrally there is a region of hypoattenuation reflecting RFA treatment (4:30). Superior to the segment VIII CyberKnife treatment zone, again seen is a focus of arterial enhancement with incomplete washout on delayed images (4:22). This measures 3.1 x 2.6 cm (previously 1.9 x 1.7 cm) and given the increase in size likely represents hepatocellular carcinoma. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The main portal vein is either diminutive or chronically occluded with evidence of cavernous transformation, as before. The spleen is markedly enlarged, measuring 19.6 cm, slightly increased in size compared to the prior study from . The pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. The stomach and visualized loops of small and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. Multiple tiny mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. A 2.3 cm aneurysm at the bifurcation of the celiac axis is not significantly changed. Similarly, a 1.2 cm right hepatic artery aneurysm (4:31) and 2.7 cm splenic artery aneurysm with thrombus (4:37) are not significantly changed in size. Large perisplenic varices are again noted. BONE WINDOW: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified. Loss of height of the L1 vertebral body is not significantly changed with a superior endplate Schmorls node. IMPRESSION: 1. Increased size of segment V lesion at the site of prior RFA with peripheral and slightly nodular arterial phase enhancement, concerning for residual tumor. 2. Increased size of focus of arterial enhancement adjacent to the segment VIII CyberKnife treatment zone which may represent a focus of hepatocellular carcinoma. 3. Diminutive or obliterated portal vein with cavernous transformation, not significantly changed compared to the prior study. 4. Splenomegaly. 5. Right hepatic artery aneurysm, splenic artery aneurysm, and aneurysm at the celiac axis bifurcation, not significantly changed. INDICATION: Elevated total bilirubin and jaundice, question of biliary obstruction. COMPARISON: Liver and gallbladder ultrasound of . FINDINGS: This study is limited. The liver is overall heterogeneous in appearance consistent with cirrhosis. The hypoechoic area in the right lobe measuring 2.3 x 3.8 x 3.4 cm at the site of prior RFA is unchanged. There is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder is normal in size and no evidence of stone or sludge. The main portal vein is seen with hepatofugal flow, similar to prior study. The common bile duct measures 5 mm. Limited views of the right kidney are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. Unchanged reversal of flow in the main portal vein. 2. Cirrhotic heterogeneous liver is similar to prior study. PORTABLE CHEST,  COMPARISON: , chest x-ray. FINDINGS: Line, support and monitoring devices are unchanged in position. Cardiomediastinal contours are stable allowing for positional differences of the patient. Dense left lower lobe opacity likely represents a combination of atelectasis and small-to-moderate pleural effusion and is unchanged. Patchy opacity at the right base is minimally better. No new or worsening areas of lung opacification. CT CHEST DATED  COMPARISON:  chest CT and  CT torso. TECHNIQUE: Volumetric, multidetector CT of the chest was performed without intravenous or oral contrast. Images were presented for display in the axial plane at 5 mm and 1.25 mm collimation. A series of multiplanar reformation images were also submitted for review. FINDINGS: Numerous small lung nodules which were described as new in  have essentially resolved. The largest lung nodule at the time of the prior study was located within the right middle lobe measuring 8 mm in diameter, and a faint area of residual ground-glass opacity is seen in this region on the current scan (image 130, series 4). However, a 3.5 mm diameter nodule in the inferior aspect of the anterior segment of the right upper lobe (image 138, 4) is slightly larger than on the prior study at which time it measured about 2.5 mm in diameter. This nodule is not clearly visible on the older CT torso of , but the thicker slices used for that examination reduce the sensitivity for detecting nodules of this size. A few scattered calcified granulomas in the lungs appear unchanged. No enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes are present. Subcentimeter lymph nodes show no interval growth from the prior studies. Heart size is normal, and coronary artery calcifications are demonstrated. Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region, but note is made of fiducial markers within the right lobe of the liver at the site of the patients treated hepatocellular carcinoma. The low-density focus in the hepatic parenchyma in this region appears similar to the prior chest CT but is not optimally evaluated without intravenous contrast. An additional seed or clip is noted in the right lobe of the liver more inferiorly and is also unchanged in position and appearance. Exam is otherwise remarkable for splenomegaly and extensive varices as well as a cirrhotic configuration of the liver. Skeletal structures are remarkable for further healing of a lower anterior right rib fracture (image 39, series 2) and further compression of a mid thoracic vertebral body, approximately the T8 vertebral body level. Previously reported mild compression deformity at T3 is unchanged. IMPRESSION: 1. Previously described new nodules on  have almost completely resolved, consistent with an infectious or inflammatory etiology. 2. 3.5 mm diameter right upper lobe anterior nodule has apparently slightly grown and is concerning for a small focus of metastatic disease. Continued CT surveillance of this lesion is recommended in three months. 3. Progressive compression deformities at the T8 vertebral body level. 4. Hepatic cirrhosis with post-treatment changes at site of hepatocellular carcinoma, incompletely evaluated on this chest CT scan. EXAM: Chest, frontal and lateral views. CLINICAL INFORMATION:  male with history of shortness of breath. . FINDINGS: Frontal and lateral views of the chest were obtained. There is interval placement of a right-sided PICC, terminating in the distal SVCcavoatrial junction. Bibasilar opacities, new since  are seen, which could relate to atelectasis, aspiration, andor infection. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is seen. Cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable. INDICATION:  man with hepatocellular carcinoma, status post radiofrequency ablation on . Patient complaining of severe abdominal pain. TECHNIQUE: Non-contrast multidetector CT images are acquired from the lung bases to the iliac crest. Sagittal and coronally reformatted images were reviewed. FINDINGS: Multiple CyberKnife seeds seen in the right lobe of liver. Post-RF ablation edematous changes seen in segment V of liver. Post RF changes extend to liver capsule and there is stranding in the adjacent fat and chest wall but no evidence of perihepatic fluid collection. There is a trace amount of fluid or edema about the gallbladder fundus which is nonspecific. Gallbladder is mildly distended with small amount of hyperdensity in the lumen consistent with vicarious excretion of contrast. There is no intrahepatic ductal dilatation. Spleen is enlarged. Extensive venous collaterals seen at the splenic hilum. Pancreas, Adrenals and Intra-abdominal small and large bowel loops are unremarkable allowing for noncontrast technique. Abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout. Known Celiac Artery aneurysm not well evaluated on the Non-contrast study. Bilateral kidneys are unremarkable with symmetric excretion of contrast from prior CT procedure. No stone or hydronephrosis. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy seen. No free fluidfree air seen in the peritoneal cavity. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES: Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are again seen with wedging of L1 vertebral body and anterior marginal osteophytosis. No lytic or sclerotic lesion suspicious for metastasis seen. IMPRESSION: Post radiofrequency ablation changes seen in segment V and adjacent perihepatic fat and chest wall. There is mild edema at the gallbladder fundus. No subcapsular chestwall hematoma or obvious bile leak seen. No other significant change from the immediate post-procedure CT done on . INDICATION: A  man with right hip pain. Please rule out fracture. TECHNIQUE: Total of three views of the pelvis and the right hip joint were obtained. FINDINGS: There is a deformity of the right femoral head with a subchondral crescentic lucency along the superior margin. There is partial collapse of the of the femoral head at this level with a flattened articular contour. Findings are most suggestive of avascular necrosis (stage III). No DJD or abnormalities at the left hip. IMPRESSION: Findings concerning for stage III right femoral head AVN as detailed above. Discussed with Dr.  at 01:30 p.m. on  by Dr. . LIVER ULTRASOUND CLINICAL INDICATION:  male with jaundice, status post RFA of small hepatoma. The liver is extremely coarse and heterogeneous in echotexture. A 3.5-cm hypoechoic area is seen just lateral to the gallbladder at the site of the prior RFA, and at the transition of this RFA lesion and hepatic parenchyma, there appears to be a more solid isoechoic portion suggestive of possible marginal recurrence. No other focal liver lesions are identified, although the views are somewhat limited due to the marked heterogeneity and attenuation of the liver. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic bile duct dilatation. The gallbladder is normal in size with no stones or sludge seen. The right portal vein is visualized and is patent with hepatofugal flow. The left portal vein cannot be assessed due to limited acoustic window. Similarly, the extrahepatic portal venous system cannot be assessed. The spleen is markedly enlarged with perisplenic varices noted. There is no evidence of ascites, and the kidneys show no hydronephrosis. CONCLUSION: Cirrhotic heterogeneous liver with no bile duct dilatation and patent right portal vein with hepatofugal flow. The remaining portal venous system could not be imaged. There is marked splenomegaly and a suggestion of possible marginal recurrence of the RFA lesion as described above.

TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pelvic outlet without intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were acquired. DLP: 1384.02 mGy-cm. COMPARISON: CT torso . CTA abdomen . FINDINGS: The pulmonary vessels and lung bases are engorged and there is dependent atelectasis. However, there is no pleural effusion. The visualized portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable. The liver is nodular along with large gastroesophageal and splenorenal varices along with splenomegaly (measuring 2.9 cm), consistent with patients known cirrhosis. CyberKnife therapy of HCC in segments V and VIII is again noted. Further evaluation of the liver is limited in the absence of intravenous contrast. The gallbladder, pancreas, and adrenals are normal. The portacaval lymph node is enlarged now measuring 2.8 x 3.2 cm (2A:31), compared to  when it measured 2.8 x 2.6 cm. The aortocaval node is also enlarged measuring 4.2 x 4.0 cm (2A:47), compared to 3.5 x 2.7 cm on . The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. There is no hydronephrosis or nephrolithiasis. There is no free intraperitoneal air. No retroperitoneal hematoma is present. CT PELVIS: The appendix is normal. The colon, rectum, seminal vesicles are unremarkable. The urinary bladder is collapsed with Foley catheter is in place. Visualization of the prostate is limited due to streak artifact from adjacent right hip arthroplasty. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy or free fluid. Scattered sigmoid diverticula are noted without evidence of diverticulitis. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Again noted are anterior wedge compression fractures at T8 and L1, unchanged from . Healing rib fractures of the left seventh through tenth ribs are again noted. IMPRESSION: 1. No retroperitoneal hematoma. 2. Enlarging portacaval and aortocaval lymph nodes as described above, consistent with progression of known HCC. 3. Cirrhosis with splenomegaly and varices, unchanged. PORTABLE CHEST X-RAY,  COMPARISON:  radiograph. FINDINGS: Indwelling support and monitoring devices are stable in appearance. Lung volumes remain low. Slight improvement in pulmonary vascular congestion, but worsening atelectasis in the left retrocardiac region with adjacent increasing small-to-moderate left pleural effusion. Patchy opacity in the right lung base medially has also worsened and likely reflects atelectasis. INDICATION: A  male with cirrhosis, status post CyberKnife therapy. COMPARISON: CT available from . TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained of the abdomen with p.o. and IV contrast. Arterial and venous phase and 3-minute delayed images were obtained. Sagittal and coronal reformats were also performed. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear without focal opacity, mass, or pleural effusion. A suboptimal arterial bolus was administered, resulting in poor arterial enhancement in the initial phase. Diffuse fatty infiltration and nodular contour of the liver is redemonstrated, compatible with known history of cirrhosis. Again, there is an ill-defined subcentimeter lesion in the gallbladder (6:20). This area has not grown since the prior study from . No new areas of enhancement are identified, although subtle lesions may be missed due to suboptimal contrast enhancement. Fiducial seeds within segments V and VIII are unchanged in position. The spleen is markedly enlarged, measuring up to 20 cm, increased from 18 cm in the prior study. Extensive perisplenic varices and splenorenal shunting is unchanged. A markedly dilated spiral left gonadal vein is stable. The celiac trunk and major branches are enlarged. There is a 23-mm celiac bifurcation aneurysm (3B:207), which has increased in size to 17 mm on . An 11-mm hepatic artery aneurysm is unchanged. A 22-mm splenic artery aneurysm (3B:204) is unchanged as well, although there has been interval shrinkage of a small non-occluding thrombus. The gallbladder, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands appear normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and appear unremarkable. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no ascites or pneumoperitoneum. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Anterior wedge deformity of the L1 vertebral body and associated Schmorls node is unchanged since . No lytic or sclerotic lesion is detected. There is no acute fracture or dislocation. IMPRESSION: 1. No significant change in the ill-defined liver lesion adjacent to the gallbladder from the  study, which may represent perfusion anomaly rather than residual tumor as it does not appear increased. No new lesions seen. Continued close follow up is recommended. 2. Persistent cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 3. Marked splenomegaly, slightly enlarged since the prior CT exam. 4. Slight enlargement in the celiac bifurcation aneurysm. Stable splenic and hepatic artery aneurysms. HISTORY: Growing segment V lesion with imaging features consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma in a patient who has underwent prior biopsy and fiducial seed placement for a lesion within segment VIII as well as therapy to the prior segment V lesion. Patient presents for RF ablation of the non treated more peripheral 2cm segment V lesion. COMPARISONS:  and  CT examinations. CT-GUIDED RF ABLATION Informed consent was obtained from the patient after explaining the risks and benefits of the procedure. A preprocedural timeout was performed documenting the nature of procedure and the patient identity using two independent verifiers. An attempt at sonographic visualization of the lesion was unsuccessful given the patients body habitus and peripheralsubcapsular location. Therefore a limited preprocedural non-contrast CT was obtained for procedural planning. This vaguely demonstrated the known lesion within segment V in close proximity to the gallbladder which was noted to start just inferior to the previously placed most inferior fiducial seed based on prior imaging. An appropriate spot for needle entry was planned. The overlying skin was prepped and draped in normal sterile fashion and under CT fluoroscopic guidance a 15 cm RF ablation electrode with a 3 cm active Cool- tip was advanced to the periphery of segment V at the expected location of the lesion. Once we felt we had appropriate needle position, a second additional limited CT examination was obtained to confirm trajectory of the electrode and ensure the entire tip was included within the hepatic parenchyma and at a safe distance from the gall bladder fossa. This was confirmed. RF ABLATION: A single 12 minute RF ablation was performed with current of 1300 mA and final peak temperatures of approximately 73 degrees Celsius. Ultrasound was for real time monitoring during ablation. iven that we felt we had adequate electrode position and coverage prior to the ablation the electrode was removed with track ablation performed and a post-procedural multiphasic CT was then obtained. POST-PROCEDURAL MULTIPHASIC LIVER CT: Initial unenhanced images display no significant proteinaceous debris with a mild amount of internal hemorrhage noted within the ablation zone. Post-contrast sequences display excellent ablation zone coverage at the periphery of segment V in the expected location of the lesion as noted on prior imaging with no residual internal arterial enhancing components and expected peripheral hyperemia surrounding the margin of the ablation. Some expected edema involving the intercostal muscles in the immediate vicinity of the peripheral ablation was noted, however no other post-procedural complications including active bleeding or subcapsular hematoma was present. No additional foci of suspicious arterial enhancing lesions were noted on todays exam with the vague region of enhancement more superiorly in segment VIII in vicinity of the fiducial seed appearing less distinct on todays study. The appearance of the liver and known underlying sequelae of portal hypertension as well as mild gynecomastia were again seen. Delayed sequences display no concerning washout at the margin of the ablation cavity with suggestion of mild washout noted involving the segment VIII lesion. Included lung bases display expected bibasilar atelectasis related to intubation. Patients splenic artery aneurysm is again noted and is little changed in size with some peripheral thrombus within. No malignant-appearing osseous lesions were noted. The procedure was performed by Dr.  Dr.  attending radiologist, who was present and participating throughout. General anesthesia was induced by the  anesthesia department. The patient was extubated in the CT operating suite without complication and transferred to the PACU in stable condition with mild pain at the entry site and referred pain to the right shoulder. IMPRESSION: 1. Successful radiofrequency ablation of peripheral growing segment V lesion which displayed imaging features of hepatocellular carcinoma. 2. Decreased conspicuity to arterial enhancing lesion with equivocal washout in segment VIII in immediate vicinity to the most superior fiducial seed. As this was in the region of a previously known biopsy-proven hepatocellular carcinoma, close continued followup of this lesion is recommended. No new suspicious arterial enhancing lesions. HISTORY: Two suspicious liver lesions, for biopsy of one lesion and fiducial marker placement. TECHNIQUE: Written and oral consent was obtained prior to the procedure. The patient was brought to the CT suite and placed in the supine position. Preliminary non-contrast helical acquisition through the upper abdomen again demonstrates hypodense hepatic lesions within segment VIII and segment V. There is somewhat limited visualization of the segment VIII lesion. Therefore, ultrasound was utilized, and sonographic interrogation of the liver demonstrates good visualization of both lesions. The overlying skin was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was achieved with a buffered 1 lidocaine solution. Conscious sedation was achieved with total doses of 3 mg of Versed, and 200 mcg of fentanyl, for a total intraservice time of 50 minutes, during which continuous hemodynamic monitoring was applied. Under sonographic guidance, the segment VIII lesion was targeted. An 18-gauge core biopsy was performed, which demonstrated hepatic tissue with no disease visualized. Therefore, a second 18-gauge core biopsy was obtained, which was deemed adequate, and highly suspicious for disease. Before and throughout the procedure, the patient had difficulty controlling his breathing, often taking large breaths even when instructed not to do so. It was felt that the patients breathing pattern placed him at increased risk for complication, and therefore at this point in the procedure, fiducial markers were placed, one at the inferior aspect of the segment VIII lesion, a second inferior to this, and a third more inferiorly within the right hepatic lobe, and the procedure was then terminated. All instruments were removed. The patient was transferred to the daycare unit for further monitoring. The patient left the department in good condition. There were no immediate post-procedure complications. Dr.  was present for the entire procedure. IMPRESSION: Successful CT- and ultrasound-guided biopsy of a segment VIII lesion, with three fiducial markers placed, as requested. INDICATION: Low platelets, altered mental status, evaluate for spontaneous bleed. COMPARISON: None available. TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the brain. No contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed. Bone algorithm was obtained. FINDINGS: There is no evidence of hemorrhage, edema, mass, mass effect, or infarction. The ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent consistent with atrophy. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well aerated. No fractures are identified. IMPRESSION: Prominent ventricles and sulci, otherwise normal study. PORTABLE AP CHEST X-RAY INDICATION: Patient with metastatic hepatocarcinoma, intubated, pneumonia versus edema. COMPARISON: Multiple chest x-rays from  to . FINDINGS: Bilateral moderate pulmonary vessel dilatation and mild pulmonary edema has improved since yesterday. ET tube ends 3.2 cm above carina. Right jugular line is at the cavoatrial junction. There is no pneumothorax. NG tube is below the diaphragm. The lung volumes are low. CONCLUSION: Mild pulmonary edema and pulmonary vessel congestion has slightly improved. CT CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST CLINICAL HISTORY: Hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein thrombus. Evaluate size and number of lesions. TECHNIQUE: CT of the Chest was performed with IV contrast; Multiphasic CT of the abdomen was performed withoutwith IV contrast. Optiray nonionic contrast was administered without complications.  CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST: There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy. Minimal vascular calcifications are seen along the coronary arteries. Heart and pericardium appear otherwise unremarkable. Examination of lung windows demonstrates some interstitial thickening and nodularity along the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe, suggesting early infectious or chronic infectious process. This is a new finding when compared to the prior examination. The lungs are otherwise clear without concerning nodules or lesions. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUTWITH IV CONTRAST: Examination of the liver demonstrates morphologic changes suggesting cirrhosis. In addition, within segment V of the liver, immediately adjacent to the gallbladder fossa, there is a lesion measuring 2.3 x 1.8 cm (series 3A, image 47) which shows arterial enhancement with washout on delayed images. Atop of the background fatty liver, there is a region within segment VIII, which is somewhat ill-defined and measuring approximately 2.9 x 3.3 cm (series 2, image 17; series 4, image 56), which is hypodense prior to the administration of IV contrast, as well as hypodense on all post-contrast phases. Notably, on the prior study from , this lesion was showing arterial enhancement and slight washout. Difference in enhancement may be secondary to contrast timing. No other hepatic lesions are seen concerning for malignancy. The hepatic artery is distended, consistent with changes related to increased hepatic arterial flow. Probable celiac artery aneurysm is again noted. The portal vein appears to be patent, though attenuated in character, and its enhancement characteristics, in conjunction with those of the splenic vein and SMV suggest the possibility that there is a reversal of directional flow within the portal vein. Note is made of near-occlusive thrombus within the splenic vein (series 3B, image 178) which may have migrated from a splenic varix a seen in . Extensive perisplenic varices are seen. Retroperitoneal varices extend along the left periaortic region into the pelvis, and beyond the inferior confines of this scan. Splenomegaly is present. The right and left adrenal glands, gallbladder, and pancreas appear unremarkable. Multiplanar reformatted images reviewed at the time of interpretation, demonstrating a wedge compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body. There appears to be a conventional hepatic artery anatomy. There also appears to be a tiny upper pole accessory left renal artery. IMPRESSION: 1. 2.2-cm arterial enhancing lesion within segment V of the liver adjacent to the gallbladder fossa, with arterial enhancement and delayed washout. These findings are highly suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma. 2. A vague hypodense region within segment VIII of the liver as described above corresponds to a region which was previously demonstrating arterial enhancement and becoming isodense to slightly washing out on delayed phase on prior examinations. Based on the prior examination, this is highly suspicious for hepatocellular carcinoma, though the lack of enhancement on todays examination may be secondary to differences in contrast bolus timing. Based on non-contrast images, this lesion is very similar in size, measuring up to 3.3 cm in long axis. 3. Diffuse fatty infiltration of the liver. 4. The portal vein, though appearing patent, is attenuated in caliber. This is unchanged when compared to prior studies. 5. Splenic vein thrombus is nearly occlusive. This may have migrated from a splenic varix thrombus previously described. 6. Extensive varices, including a dominant retroperitoneal varix which extends into the pelvis. 7. Splenomegaly. 8. New patchy opacity seen along the posterior aspect of the right upper lobe. Appearances are suggestive of early or resolving infection. Please correlate with clinical findings. INDICATION:  man with hepatocellular carcinoma status post RFA ablation and CyberKnife treatment. Evaluate for response. COMPARISON: Multiple prior CTs, most recently CT chest of  and CT abdomen of . TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained in a multiphasic fashion from the lung bases to the iliac crest. 150 mL of Omnipaque IV contrast was administered. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats. DLP: 2346 mGy-cm. FINDINGS: ABDOMEN: The visualized heart is normal. Trace bibasilar atelectasis is present and the lung bases are otherwise clear. Sub-centimeter upper lung pulmonary nodules on  chest CT are not imaged on this exam. The pericardium and pleura are intact without effusion. Hepatic segment V lesion has undergone prior RFA and measures 43 x 37 mm (3B:156), prior 45 x 39. There is peripheral arterial enhancement that becomes iso-enhancing on delayed imaging with a central hypodense region. No significant change in this lesion. Hepatic segment VIII lesion has undergone CyberKnife therapy and measures 68 x 43 mm (3B:144), prior 64 x 43 mm. There is peripheral arterial enhancement that becomes iso-enhancing on delayed imaging. No significant change in this lesion. Two additional arterially enhancing foci are present, one in segment VII measuring 9 x 10 mm (3A:42), prior 10 x 10, and another in segment VI-VII measuring 10 x 10 mm, similar to prior. Both are similar to the prior exam. No new hepatic lesions are identified. Three fiducial markers are again identified in the right hepatic lobe. The gross morphology of the liver is nodular, compatible with known cirrhosis. The portal vein is again seen to be thrombosed with the tumor burden extending to the portosplenic confluence. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein is again seen. There are associated large tortuous splenic, gastric, esophageal, and periumbilical varices. Lesions previously characterized as celiac, splenic, and hepatic artery aneurysms may be more compatible with tortuous vessels. The areas of interest are celiac artery (3A:57) measuring 13 x 9 mm , hepatic artery (3A:42) measuring 9 x 9 mm, partially thrombosed splenic artery (3A:53) measuring 33 x 22 mm, and distal splenic artery (3A:57) measuring 14 x 9 mm. The gallbladder is unremarkable. Splenomegaly is again present. Bilateral adrenal glands are normal. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically. The esophagus and stomach are normal. The visualized small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber. Diverticulosis is present without diverticulitis. The appendix is normal. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. No free abdominal fluid, pneumoperitoneum, or abdominal wall hernia. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Wedge compression deformity of T8 vertebral body appears new since the prior exam. L1 wedge deformity with superior endplate depression is unchanged since . IMPRESSION: 1. T8 wedge compression deformity, likely new since the prior exam. 2. Stable appearance of hepatic lesions, as documented above. No evidence of new metastatic disease. 3. Celiac axis vascular abnormalities are stable and may represent tortuous vessels rather than aneurysms. Findings were entered into the critical results database. STUDY: Portable abdominal radiograph. COMPARISON: CT abdomen and pelvis . INDICATION:  metastatic HCC with C. diff, concern for ileus versus toxic megacolon. FINDINGS: There are no dilated loops of bowel or air-fluid levels. There is no free air or pneumatosis. Dobbhoff tube is present with its tip in the stomach; however, the side hole likely is in the lower esophagus or in the GE junction. Air bronchograms are present in the left lower lobe. There is a right hip arthroplasty. IMPRESSION: 1. No dilated loops of bowel or air-fluid levels. 2. NG tube with side hole in the lower esophagus or GE junction. The tube should be advanced several centimeters. 3. Air bronchograms in the left lower lobe indicative of consolidation. Pneumonia cannot be excluded. INDICATION:  man with liver tumor status post Cyberknife radiosurgery. COMPARISON: CT of the abdomen of . TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen prior to and after the administration of 150 mL of Optiray intravenous contrast. Arterial and venous phase images were obtained. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also displayed. FINDINGS: The lung bases are clear bilaterally without pulmonary nodules. The heart size is normal. The spleen remains enlarged with perisplenic varices and splenorenal shunt, stable. A small hypodensity within the spleen remains, but is too small to characterize. Within the area of the previously seen occlusive thrombus in the one of the varices, a small venous remnant is now seen (3B:182). There is no thrombosis seen within the vascular structures on todays study. The stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are within normal limits. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free air or free fluid. There are two right renal arteries. The splenic artery aneurysm remains stable in size at approximately 26 x 22 mm. The aneursym at the celiac trunk bifurcation is also stable at 1.7 cm. Within segment VIII and VVI of the liver are three Cyberknife seeds. The previously described liver lesion seen in segment VIII is not well seen today due to streak artifact from the seeds, but it is not larger than on the previous study. However, an arterially enhancing lesion which measures 12 x 13 mm located to the right of the gallbladder fossa (3B:41), seen on the previous study, is unchanged in size. No new hepatic lesions are identified. BONE WINDOWS: A mild anterior wedge compression deformity is noted of vertebral body L1, which has slightly increased since the previous study of . No suspicious osseous lesions are identified. IMPRESSION: 1. Of the two previously noted enhancing lesions within the liver, the largest one is not well seen; however, the smaller one is still present, unchanged. 2. Stable prominent splenorenal shunt. Stable appearance of previously noted aneurysm at the celiac trunk bifurcation and probable stable size of splenic artery aneurysm. REASON FOR THE EXAMINATION: This is a  man with history of HCC. The patient is status post RF ablation and CyberKnife treatment for two HCC lesions. The request is to assess for interval growth in the liver cancer. COMPARISON: Previous CT examination from .

The lesion show peripheral nodular enhancement that become isointense on delayed imaging with central hypodense region. The segment VIII post-CyberKnife treatment lesion measures on current examination 64 x 43 mm (5, 24) compared to 31 x 25 mm on previous examination. The lesion shows mild arterial enhancement that become isointense on delayed imaging. Two additional arterial enhancing foci are seen one is seen in segment VII measuring 10 x 10 mm (4, 28) and the other is an ill-defined lesion that is seen in the border of segment VI and segment VII (4, 30). Both foci were seen on previous examination and are grossly unchanged. The portal vein is thrombosed with mild cavernous transformation that is seen. Small opacified portion of the right anterior portal vein is seen. The spleen is enlarged measuring 20 cm. Multiple porto-systemic collaterals are seen that include esophageal, paraumbilical, left gastric, small gastric, perisplenic, and  collaterals, grossly unchanged from previous examination. Reidentified is a celiac artery aneurysm measuring 14.7 x 14.7 (4, 41) unchanged in comparison to previous examination. Hepatic artery aneurysm is re-identified measuring 13 x 17 mm (4, 31), unchanged with comparison to prior examination. Partially thrombosed splenic artery aneurysm is seen again measuring 90 x 40 mm (4, 36) unchanged in comparison to previous examination. No ascites is seen. The pancreas, the adrenals, and the kidneys are unremarkable. The small and large bowels are within normal limits. No lymphadenopathy is seen. Bony structures are within normal limits. IMPRESSION: 1. Interval increase in the size of segment V lesion at the site of prior RFA compatible with enlarging residual tumor. 2. Interval increase in the size of segment VIII CyberKnife treatment zone which is compatible with enlarging residual tumor. 3. Stable appearance of two arterially enhancing foci as described might represent few HCC foci. Follow-up examination is recommended. 4. Unchanged portal vein thrombosis with portal hypertension signs that include splenomegaly and extensive portosystemic collaterals. No ascites is detected.\n",

TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired without intravenous contrast. Non-contrast scan has several limitations in detecting vascular and parenchymal organ abnormalities, including tumor detection. Oral contrast was administered via the NG tube. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 8.4 s, 54.4 cm; CTDIvol  23.0 mGy (Body) DLP  1,235.9 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body)  1,236 mGy-cm. COMPARISON: CT abdomen performed earlier on the same day at 17:48 FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: There is minimal bibasilar dependent atelectasis. Partially visualized is a right breast implant. Coronary artery calcification is partially imaged. ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions within the limitations of an unenhanced scan. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. There is small amount of layering hyperdensity within the gallbladder likely sludge. No radiopaque calculi. PANCREAS: There is a focal cluster of coarse calcification within the uncinate process of the pancreas (02:45) that remains unchanged when compared to multiple prior imaging scans dating back to . There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions within the limitations of an unenhanced scan. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no nephrolithiasis. There is no perinephric abnormality. GASTROINTESTINAL: Patient has history notable for a primary peritoneal serous carcinoma status post debulking surgery complicated by subsequent abdominal surgeries for bowel perforation and enterocutaneous fistula and ventral hernia. Patient has had 2 small bowel anastomosis and 1 colonic anastomosis. Patient is also postop day 4 from ventral hernia repair and enterocutaneous fistula takedown. The patient had a CT with rectal contrast on the same day, earlier at 17:48. This exam demonstrates persistence of the rectal contrast within the sigmoid colon without a leak. The rectally administered contrast does not reach the 2 anastomosis in the small bowel. Oral contrast has been administered, however persists in the stomach without distal passage to the site of the anastomoses. Hence evaluation for leak or fistula is limited given the location of rectal and oral contrast. Dilated fluid-filled small bowel loops proximal to the seconddistal anastomosis with decompression of distal small bowel loops raise concern for obstruction at the site of the second anastomosis. PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is not clearly visualized. No adnexal masses. LYMPH NODES: There are no enlarged abdominal or pelvic lymph nodes. VASCULAR: An IVC filter is noted in place. Mild atherosclerotic calcification of the abdominal aorta and its branches without aneurysmal dilation. BONES: Multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine noted. No osteolytic or blastic bone lesions identified. SOFT TISSUES: There are scattered foci of air in the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior abdominal wall and in the peritoneum. This is most likely postsurgical. However, a fistula cannot be ruled out. There is a hyperdense fluid collection in the deep anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous tissues, in the surgical bed measuring approximately 13.2 x 2.2 cm in maximum transaxial  (2:76) that likely represents a hematoma. A surgical drain is well positioned within this fluid collection. This collection appears unchanged compared to the earlier CT. There is extensive stranding of subcutaneous fat in bilateral postero- lateral flanks. Scattered subcutaneous soft tissue nodules in the anterior abdominal wall are likely related to subcutaneous injections. IMPRESSION: 1. Orally administered contrast is seen within the stomach and has not passed distally to the site of the two small bowel anastomoses, limiting evaluation for a leak. 2. The rectally administered contrast, earlier on the same day persists within the sigmoid colon, also has not progressed to the site of the anastomoses. The opacified portion of the colon does not demonstrate any leak. 3. Dilated fluid-filled small bowel loops proximal to the seconddistal anastomosis with decompression of distal small bowel loops raise concern for obstruction at the site of the second anastomosis. 4. Scattered foci of air in the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior abdominal wall as well as locules of free intraperitoneal air are likely postsurgical. 5. Anterior abdominal wall hematoma is unchanged compared to the prior exam, the surgical drain is appropriately positioned within the hematoma. RECOMMENDATION(S): If there is ongoing concern for a leak -a repeat CT with oral contrast and close monitoring to ensure that the contrast reaches the anastomoses is recommended.

Coronary artery calcifications. Heart is enlarged. Abdomen and Pelvis: Hepatobiliary: There are no focal hepatic abnormalities. Gallbladder is normal. No bile duct dilatation. Spleen: Normal Adrenals: Normal Kidneys, Bladder, Ureters: No renal abnormalities. No hydronephrosis. Normal gallbladder. Pancreas: New stable focal area of coarse calcification involving uncinate process of the pancreas, likely sequela of chronic pancreatitis. No peripancreatic inflammatory changes. Gastrointestinal: Enteric tube is in place with tip in the mid stomach. Postoperative changes in the abdomen, with 2 areas of small bowel anastomosis, and 1 rectal anastomosis. Contrast was present in the stomach on most recent CT exam is no longer in the stomach. Proximal small bowel loops are dilated to the level of the second, or more distal of the 2 small bowel anastomoses, small bowel loops distal to the anastomosis are decompressed and collapsed, stable, findings consistent with small-bowel obstruction. The air and fluid collection that was immediately deep to the peritoneal surface in the anterior, upper abdomen seen on  at 17:48, which had resolved by follow-up exam of  at 23:45 is also absent today, with tiny residual focus of fluid remaining measuring 1.2 cm x 1.5 cm. There are few air bubbles along the right lateral abdomen, and small volume of fluid, which is stable since 2 prior exams. There is 6.0 cm x 2.7 cm fluid collection in the anterior, low pelvis series 4, image 72, with new small air bubble within, which on  at 23:45 measured 6.0 cm by 2.0 cm. This fluid collection had small area of contrast within it on exam from  at 17:48, and unless this represents surgically created limb, it is suggestive for leak. Fluoroscopy enema might be helpful in further evaluation. There is stable adjacent right lateral pelvic stranding with few air bubbles, which has small areas of high density within it, which is indeterminate, is stable on all 3 exams, and may be postsurgical image 64. Overall volume of peritoneal free air bubbles, an small volume fluid elsewhere is similar since most recent exam. Again seen are postoperative changes of anterior abdominal wall, with surgical drains in place, mild volume of blood products within surgical bed extraperitoneally, with stable volume of subcutaneous air, findings may be postsurgical. Lymph Nodes: No adenopathy. Pelvis: As above Vascular: Mild atherosclerotic changes. IVC filter in place. Soft Tissues: As above soft tissue edema. Bones: No worrisome lesions. No changes. IMPRESSION: There is 6.0 cm x 2.7 cm fluid collection in the anterior low pelvis, adjacent to the colon, with new air bubble within it. This had small volume of contrast within it 2 CTs ago along back and abut. Unless this is surgically created limb, in may represent a leak. Exam under fluoroscopy may be helpful in further evaluation. Remainder of the exam stable. There are dilated small bowel loops proximal to the second small bowel anastomosis point, suggesting small bowel obstruction, stable. Stable scattered areas of air and small volume fluid elsewhere in the peritoneal cavity. Extensive postoperative changes anterior abdominal wall is stable, with residual air, drains, likely postsurgical, with stable mild volume postoperative blood products.

Patient is postop day 4 from ventral hernia repair and enterocutaneous fistula takedown. Please perform CT scan with rectal contrast to evaluate for anastomotic leak. Patient has two small bowel anastomoses and onecolonic anastomosis. TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired without intravenous contrast but with the administration of rectal contrast instilled by the  rectal team. Non-contrast scan has several limitations in detecting vascular and parenchymal organ abnormalities, including tumor detection. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 8.5 s, 55.4 cm; CTDIvol  22.6 mGy (Body) DLP  1,235.2 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body)  1,235 mGy-cm. COMPARISON: CT abdomen pelvis from  and  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Evaluation of the lung bases limited by motion. There are 2 indeterminate nodular opacities in the left lung base, larger measures 0.8 cm, improved since prior exam. There is bibasilar atelectasis. A nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm into the stomach. There is a small hiatal hernia. A right breast implant is incompletely visualized. Coronary artery calcifications ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions within the limitations of an unenhanced scan. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: Coarse calcifications in the region of the uncinate process of the pancreas are unchanged and may represent sequela of prior pancreatitis. There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions within the limitations of an unenhanced scan. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no nephrolithiasis. There is no perinephric abnormality. GASTROINTESTINAL: Patient is status post ventral hernia repair. There is a moderate amount of air within the anterior abdominal subcutaneous tissues with component with high attenuation inferiorly measuring 7 cm x 2.5 cm, along the course of the inferior most surgical drain. Air bubbles are likely postsurgical, clinically correlate to exclude infection. Drains traverses the anterior abdominal hernia repair site. No residual hernia is identified and the bowel remains within the abdominal cavity. Patient is status post takedown of an enterocutaneous fistula in the right abdomen. There is air-fluid collection just deep to the the peritoneal cavity anterior mid abdomen series 3, image 36, with fluid collection measuring 5 cm x 2 cm series 3, image 42, and air collection immediately above it. This is abutting anterior abdominal wall, and there is some air and small volume fluid anterior to the peritoneal cavity at the surgical bed of the subcutaneous fat, which tracks inferiorly towards the drains described above. Findings may represent intra-abdominal leak or infection. Repeat exam with oral contrast would be helpful. This area is not in contiguity with with dilated small bowel loops, is near some decompressed bowel loops, and transit time to this area may be prolonged. There is a mild amount of gas, and small volume of unorganized, non drainable fluid elsewhere within the abdomen. Intra-abdominal mesenteric fat stranding is also likely related to recent surgery. Rectal contrast opacifies loops of sigmoid colon, no evidence of extraluminal contrast. Contrast does not reach the two visualized small bowel anastomoses. The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops in the left abdomen are dilated with air-fluid levels with extending to the distal-most anastomosis (series 3, image 53), small bowel loops are decompressed distal to it, findings are concerning for obstruction at the anastomotic site. PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. An IVC filter is present. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. There are chronic left lower lateral rib fractures. There are degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, bilateral hips, sacroiliac joints. SOFT TISSUES: There is severe soft tissue stranding in the bilateral flanks. Likely related to recent tissue expanders which have been removed. Again seen are soft tissue nodular densities in the subcutaneous tissues of the anterior abdomen likely related to subcutaneous injections. IMPRESSION: 1. There is small bowel obstruction at distal most small bowel anastomosis. Distal small bowel loops are collapsed. 2. Air and fluid collection deep to the peritoneal cavity in the anterior mid abdomen, may represent leak or infection. There is some air and fluid extraperitoneally in the surgical bed at the subcutaneous anterior abdominal fat, which may be postsurgical, however, given history may represent fistula communicating with intra-abdominal contents or infection. 3. Mild amount of intra-abdominal free air, non organized fluid. 4. Irregular appearing fluid density air within the anterior abdominal wall may be related to the small volume hemorrhage from recent ventral hernia repair.

Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. TECHNIQUE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained to the patient. After a detailed discussion, informed written consent was obtained. A pre-procedure timeout using three patient identifiers was performed per  protocol. The patient was placed in a supine position on the CT scan table. Limited preprocedure CTscan of the intended biopsy area was performed. Based on the CT findings an appropriate position for the biopsy was chosen. The site was marked. The site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. 1 lidocaine were administered to the subcutaneous and deep tissues for local anesthetic effect. Under CT guidance, a 17 gauge coaxial needle was introduced into the lesion. An 18 gauge core biopsy device with a 22 mm throw was used to obtain 3 core biopsy specimens, which were sent for pathology. The procedure was tolerated well and there were no immediate post-procedural complications.

ANESTHESIA: 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: None CONTRAST: None FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 1.2 min, 119 cGy PROCEDURE: 1. Double lumen PICC placement through the basilic vein on the left. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the basilic vein on the left was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. A peel-away sheath was then placed over a guidewire. The guidewire was then advanced into the superior vena cava using fluoroscopic guidance. A double lumen PIC line measuring 41 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the distal SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. FINDINGS: 1. The accessed vein was patent and compressible. 2. Basilicvein approach double lumen left PICC with tip in the distal SVC.

TECHNIQUE: Portable AP radiograph. COMPARISON: Chest radiograph from  at 05:51. CTA from  at 09:40. FINDINGS: Apparent widening of the mediastinum is continuous with thickened left apical pleural margin, obscuring the aortic knob. This may represent either widened mediastinum due to bleeding or extravasation or pleural fluid tracking superiorly in the supine patient. Of note a large vascular introducer has been removed from the left neck and upper mediastinum since  and could be a source of bleeding. .

ANESTHESIA: General anesthesia was administered by the anesthesiology department. Please refer to anesthesiology notes for details. CONTRAST: 70 ml of Optiray contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 12.5 min, 923 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Right common femoral artery access. 2. Inferior mesenteric arteriogram. 3. Left colic arteriogram. 4. Left colic arterial embolization with gelfoam and coils. 5. Post embolization inferior mesenteric arteriogram. 6. Right common femoral artery arteriogram. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Emergency consent was presumed after attempts at contacting a health care proxy were made. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The right groin was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Using palpatory, fluoroscopic, and ultrasound guidance, the right common femoral artery was punctured using a micropuncture set at the level of the mid-femoral head. A 0.018 wire was passed easily into the vessel lumen. A small skin incision was made over the needle. Then the inner dilator and wire were removed and  wire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the aorta. The micropuncture sheath was exchanged for a 5  sheath which was attached to a continuous heparinized saline side arm flush. A C2 Cobra catheter was advanced over  wire into the aorta. The wire was removed and the inferior mesenteric artery was selectively cannulated and a small contrast injection was made to confirm position. A inferior mesenteric arteriogram was performed. A STC microcatheter pre-loaded with a headliner wire was used to access the left colic artery and a left colic arteriogram was performed. Left colic arterial embolization was performed with gelfoam followed by 2 mm x 2 cm Hilal coils (x4) and 3 mm x 2 cm Hilal coils (x1). The micro catheter was removed. A contrast injection was then made into the C2 Cobra catheter, confirming position within the inferior mesenteric artery. An inferior mesenteric artery arteriogram was performed post embolization. The catheter was removed. A contrast injection was made into the sheath, performing a right common femoral artery arteriogram, to delineate the access site. The sheath was removed. Hemostasis was achieved with an Angio-Seal device and manual pressure. A sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure without immediate complication. FINDINGS: 1. Inferior mesenteric arteriogram shows three areas of active extravasation, at least 2 of which arise from the left colic artery. 2. Left colic arteriogram demonstrates active extravasation. 3. Left colic arterial embolization with gelfoam and coils to stasis with good angiographic result. 4. Post embolization inferior mesenteric arteriogram demonstrates embolization of the left colic artery, and no further active extravasation. IMPRESSION: Active bleeding from the left colic artery, treated with Gelfoam and coil embolization, with good angiographic result. RECOMMENDATION(S): Keep the left leg straight straight for 2 hrs.

EXAMINATION: CT guided abdominal collection drainage INDICATION:  year old woman sp colectomy and colostomy  Drinage of 13.1 cm abcess in Left gutter COMPARISON: CT scan performed  PROCEDURE: CT-guided drainage of a left abdominal collection. OPERATORS: Dr.  fellow and Dr.  radiologist. Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. TECHNIQUE: The risks, benefits, and alternatives of the procedure were explained to the patient. After a detailed discussion, informed written consent was obtained. A pre-procedure timeout using three patient identifiers was performed per  protocol. The patient was placed in a supine position on the CT scan table. Limited preprocedure CT scan was performed to localize the collection. Based on the CT findings an appropriate skin entry site for the drain placement was chosen. The site was marked. Local anesthesia was administered with 1 Lidocaine solution. Using intermittent CT fluoroscopic guidance, an 18-G  needle was inserted into the collection. A sample of fluid was aspirated, confirming needle position within the collection. 0.038  wire was placed through the needle and needle was removed. This was followed by placement of  Exodus pigtail catheter into the collection. The plastic stiffener and the wire were removed. The pigtail was deployed. The position of the pigtail was confirmed within the collection via CT fluoroscopy. Approximately 100 cc of yellowish fluid was aspirated with a sample sent for microbiology evaluation. The catheter was secured by a StatLock. The catheter was attached to suction bulb. Sterile dressing was applied. The procedure was tolerated well, and there were no immediate post-procedural complications. Sample was sent for laboratory analysis. DOSE: DLP: Total DLP (Body)  2,917 mGy-cm. mGy-cm SEDATION: Moderate sedation was not provided as the patients blood pressure was slightly decreased. Only local anesthesia was given. The patients vitals were monitored by a Radiology Nurse continuously throughout the procedure. FINDINGS: Preprocedure scan once again demonstrated the presence of a collection along the left pericolic gutter, today measuring 14.7 x 10.2 cm in axial plane. A nasogastric tube is seen with tip coiled in the body of the stomach. There is contrast seen in the gallbladder, compatible with vicarious contrast excretion. There is residual contrast noted in the kidneys from yesterdays scan. This patient is at high risk for contrast induced nephropathy, and close evaluation with serum creatinine as well as hydration is recommended as tolerated. At the site of the patients anterior abdominal incision there is a 2.4 x 3.5 cm pocket of complex appearing material. This may represent surgical packing. It is unlikely to represent a bowel loop. Unfortunately, the entirety of the region is not imaged on the current examination. Recommend correlation with any surgical packing at this level. Also recommend clinical evaluation for any evidence of fecal discharge through the anterior incision. An IVC filter is seen in the infrarenal IVC. Remainder as detailed on previous CT scan.

ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 200 mcg of fentanyl and 3.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 105 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: Fentanyl and versed. CONTRAST: None. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 1 min, 1 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Tunneled non-dialysis line placement PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The access site was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent left internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A tunneled double lumen central venous catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire. The catheter could not be advanced through the peel-away sheath due to kinking of the peel-away sheath. Subsequently, a short Amplatz wire was advanced through the peel-away sheath and the peel-away sheath was removed. Then a new 8  30 cm peel-away sheath was then placed into the IVC. The catheter could not be advanced through this peel-away sheath either. A stiff Glidewire and the catheter were advanced into the peel-away sheath. The peel-away sheath was removed and the stiff Glidewire and catheter were advanced further into the right atrium. The Glidewire was removed. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and each lumen was capped. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures.  subcuticular Vicryl sutures and Dermabond were used to close the venotomy incision site. Steri-Strips were applied. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: Patent left internal jugular vein. Final fluoroscopic image showing tunneled double-lumen central venous catheter with tip terminating in the right atrium. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a tunneled double lumen central venous catheter via the right internal jugular venous approach. The tip of the catheter terminates in the right atrium. The catheter is ready for use. INDICATION:  year old woman with left sided  catheter placed at  in  now coiled in azygos vein. Please please place double lumen non-power tunneled access line. COMPARISON: Chest x-ray dated  TECHNIQUE: OPERATORS: Dr. , Dr.   and Dr.  radiologist performed the procedure. Dr.  supervised the trainee during the key components of the procedure and has reviewed and agrees with the trainees findings. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 150 mcg of fentanyl and 4 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 2 hours 15 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 21.9 min, 220 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Attempted but unsuccessful left tunneled  catheter exchange 2. New placement of left internal jugular vein approach tunneled  catheter PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The left neck and upper chest including the existing tunneled catheter were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Scout radiograph identified the existing left tunneled catheter to be malpositioned with tip in the azygos vein. The catheter was successfully aspirated and flushed. Two V18 microwires were advanced through the existing catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. The catheter was successfully repositioned with its tip in the right atrium. The wires were removed. However, at the end of the procedure, the catheter could not be aspirated and flushed. A fracture was identified in the proximal catheter near the hub. Decision was made to place a new left internal jugular vein approach tunneled  catheter. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent left internal jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. The existing left tunneled  catheter was removed. Manual pressure for 5 minutes was held to ensure hemostasis. Next, attention was turned towards creation of a tunnel over the upper anterior chest wall. After instilling superficial and deeper local anesthesia using lidocaine mixed with epinephrine, a small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site. A double lumen  catheter was selected and cut to 27 cm tip to cuff length. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire. The wire and inner dilator were removed. The catheter was advanced into the peel-away sheath but could not be passed centrally into the left brachiocephalic vein due to crimping of the peel-away sheath. A Transcend microwire was advanced through the catheter to provide support; however, the catheter could still not be advanced through the peel-away sheath. The catheter was removed and  wire was readvanced through the peel-away sheath. The inner dilator was advanced over the wire. The kit  sheath was then exchanged for an  peel-away sheath. A safety access Transcend microwire was advanced through the sheath to ensure access. Next, the catheter was advanced through the peel-away sheath to the point of prior crimping. The peel-away sheath was carefully removed while maintaining forward pressure on the catheter. The catheter was carefully advanced forward and eventually successfully placed within the right atrium. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and each lumen was capped. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures.  Vicryl suture was used to close the venotomy incision site. Steri-Strips were applied. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: 1. Existing left tunneled Hickman catheter was malpositioned with tip in the azygos vein. A fracture was also noted in the proximal catheter near the hub. 2. Patent left internal jugular vein.

ANESTHESIA: 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: 1 lidocaine CONTRAST: 10 ml of Optiray contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 4:20 min, 229 cGycm2 PROCEDURE: 1. Repositioning of left PICC. 2. Left cephalic arch venogram. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the existing PICC line was aspirated and flushed. After trimming the hub of the PICC, a Nitinol wire was threaded into the cephalic arch. However, the wire would not advance centrally. The PICC tubing was removed, and a 4  MPA catheter was advanced over the wire. The wire was removed, and a venogram of the cephalic arch was performed. This demonstrated stenosis of the cephalic arch, with patent central veins. The wire was then attempted to be advanced centrally, however, the Nitinol wire would not advance. The Nitinol wire was exchanged for a double angled Glidewire, which was then successfully navigated into the SVC, and finally into the IVC. The MPA catheter was then advanced over the wire. The double angled Glidewire was exchanged for the Nitinol wire, which was used for measuring purposes. The MPA catheter was exchanged for the PICC sheath. A double lumen PIC line measuring 42 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath with its tip positioned in the distal SVC under fluoroscopic guidance.

ANESTHESIA: 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: 1 buffered lidocaine subcutaneous injection CONTRAST: 0 ml of Optiray contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 16.7 min, 219 mGy PROCEDURE: 1. Single lumen PICC placement through the left basilic vein. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Using sterile technique and local anesthesia, the left basilic vein was punctured under direct ultrasound guidance using a micropuncture set. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Attempts to pass the Nitinol wire via the needle access into the central veins were unsuccessful. The micropuncture needle was removed and the inner dilator portion of the micropuncture sheath was inserted over the wire into the vein. Next, utilizing a 0.018 angled Glidewire, central access was obtained and the wire was able to pass into the inferior vena cava. Next, the inner dilator of the micropuncture sheath was removed and replaced with a 0.018 Rubicon catheter which was able to pass into the right atrium. The angled Glidewire was removed and replaced with a V18 wire. Next, the 0.018 Rubicon catheter was removed and replaced with a 0.035 Rubicon catheter. An additional SV8 wire was placed in tandem via the 0.035 Rubicon catheter. The 0.035 Rubicon catheter was removed and the inner dilator of a 5  peel-away sheath was inserted over the wire. Attempts were made to insert a double lumen PICC over the 2 wires however this was unsuccessful. The 0.035 Rubicon catheter was used to exchange the 0.018 wires for a 0.035 glidewire. A single lumen PIC line measuring 44 cm in length was then placed through the peel-away sheath over the glidewire with its tip positioned in the distal SVC under fluoroscopic guidance. Position of the catheter was confirmed by a fluoroscopic spot film of the chest. The peel-away sheath and guidewire were then removed. The catheter was secured to the skin, flushed, and a sterile dressing applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate complications. FINDINGS: 1. The accessed vein was patent and compressible. Attempts to pass a double lumen PICC centrally via the obtained left basilic vein access was unsuccessful and thought to be secondary to a focal stenosis which could not be verified with venography due to the patient having an IV dye contrast allergy 2.

Dr.   supervised the trainee during any key components of the procedure where applicable and reviewed and agrees with the findings as reported below. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 200mcg of fentanyl and 4.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 120 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: None CONTRAST: 0 ml of Optiray contrast FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 28.5, 219 mGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE: 1. Attempted but unsuccessful left tunneled  catheter replacement. PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The left neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. A 4  dilator was inserted into the dermatotomy and used to recannulate the left anterior chest wall tunnel tract. A Glidewire was advanced through the 4  sheath and into the jugular vein (Presumed to be the external). The wire was passed to the right atrium. The sheath was exchanged for a Kumpe catheter and the wire was advanced into the IVC. Exchange was then made for an amplatz wire which was advanced into the IVC. The Kumpe catheter was then exchanged for a 8  peel-away sheath which was advanced only into the brachiocephalic vein, but would not advance further centrally. The inner dilator was removed with return of blood. The  catheter was pre-loaded with a transcend microwire but attempts to advance the catheter into the  were unsuccessful. The decision was made to make a new access into the jugular vein. The patent left external jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture kit. A Ampltaz wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. A small skin incision was made at the tunnel entry site after the subcutaneous tissues were infiltrated with local anesthesia. A double lumen  Fr  catheter was tunneled to the venotomy site. A peel away sheath was advanced over the Amplatz wire and the inner dilator was removed. The catheter was advanced into the peel-away sheath though could not be passed centrally into the left brachiocephalic vein due to crimping of the peel-away sheath with removal of the dilator. Multiple wires were advanced through the catheter to provide support, however, the catheter could not be advanced through the peel-away sheath. The 7  peel-away sheath was then exchanged for an 8  peel-away sheath over the wire, however, the sheath again kinked with removal of the inner dilator and attempts at advancing the  Fr catheter through the peel-away sheath, despite pre-loading the catheter with a fathom 016 wire, were unsuccessful. The patient was not tolerating the procedure well largely due to anxiety. At this point access was given up and manual pressure was applied for 5 minutes to achieve hemostasis. FINDINGS: Continued patency of the left tunneled catheter tract with unsuccessful attempts to replace the tunneled  catheter due to inability to advance the catheter. New left jugular access with inability to advance the catheter due to kinking of the jugularbrachiocephalic vein possibly related to scar tissue. IMPRESSION: Unsuccessful or placement of a tunneled-catheter via the left internal jugular venous approach. RECOMMENDATION(S): The patient will return for re-attempt of vascular access with anesthesia support given intolerance to the procedure.

Dr.  supervised during the key components of the procedure and has reviewed and agrees with the findings. ANESTHESIA: Moderate sedation was provided by administrating divided doses of 200 mcg of fentanyl and 3.5 mg of midazolam throughout the total intra-service time of 45 minutes during which the patients hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored by an independent trained radiology nurse. 1 lidocaine was injected in the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the access site. MEDICATIONS: None CONTRAST: 0 ml of Optiray contrast. FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE: 15.8 min, 52 mGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The left neck was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Two transcend were advanced through each lumen of the left internal jugular approach tunneled  catheter. The cuff was loosened. The line was removed over the wires. Next 8  peel-away sheath was advanced over the two transcend wires however there was difficulty with advancing the peel-away sheath advanced through the venotomy. The peel-away sheath was then removed and a 5  Kumpe the catheter was then advanced over the transcend wires into the IVC. Exchange was made for Amplatz wire and the 8  peel-away sheath was advanced into the brachiocephalic vein. The Amplatz wire and inner dilator were removed. A new 7  dual-lumen  catheter was cut to a length of 28 cm from tip to cuff and was preloaded with a Transcend wire. The  catheter and Transcend wire were advanced through the peel-away sheath. The peel-away sheath was removed and the tip was guided into the right atrium under fluoroscopy. The Transcend wire was removed. Both access ports were aspirated, flushed and capped. The catheter was secured to the skin with a 0 silk suture and sterile dressings were applied. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications. FINDINGS: Catheter tip in the right atrium. IMPRESSION: Over the wire exchange of a left internal jugular approach 7  dual lumen Hickman 28 cm tip to cuff catheter. INDICATION:  year old woman with peritoneal carcinomatosis Needs  for TPN COMPARISON: Tunneled line placement attempt  TECHNIQUE: OPERATORS: Dr.  Radiologist performed the procedure. ANESTHESIA: General MEDICATIONS: CONTRAST: None FLUOROSCOPY TIME AND DOSE:  MIN, 31 mGy PROCEDURE: PROCEDURE DETAILS: Following the explanation of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure, written informed consent was obtained from the patient. The patient was then brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the exam table. A pre-procedure time-out was performed per  protocol. The left upper chest was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Focused ultrasound showed a external jugular vein in the expected position of the left internal jugular vein. Under continuous ultrasound guidance, the patent right external jugular vein was compressible and accessed using a micropuncture needle. Permanent ultrasound images were obtained before and after intravenous access, which confirmed vein patency. Subsequently a Nitinol wire was passed into the right atrium using fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture sheath. The Nitinol wire was removed and a short  wire was advanced to make appropriate measurements for catheter length. The  wire was then passed distally into the IVC. The tunnel entry site created on the prior day was used. A  Fr dual lumen tunneled  catheter was selected. The catheter was tunneled from the entry site towards the venotomy site from where it was brought out using a tunneling device. The venotomy tract was dilated using the introducer of the peel-away sheath supplied. Following this, the peel-away sheath was placed over the  wire through which the catheter was threaded through. Excessive resistance to catheter advancement was encountered. Fluoroscopy confirmed kinking of the sheath. The catheter was strengthened with Transcend and V18 wires serially but could not be advanced. Ultimately, the peel-away sheath was removed over a wire and a larger peel-away sheath was advanced to allow the passage of a larger  dual lumen tunneled  catheter. This catheter was tunneled from the existing skin entry site and successfully threaded through the peel-away sheath into the right atrium. The sheath was then peeled away. The catheter was sutured in place with 0 silk sutures.  subcuticular Vicryl sutures and Steri-strips were also used to close the venotomy incision site. A  subcuticular pursestring stitch was tied at the tunnel skin entrance site. Final spot fluoroscopic image demonstrating good alignment of the catheter and no kinking. The tip is in the right atrium. The catheter was flushed and both lumens were capped. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. FINDINGS: Patent left external jugular vein. Final fluoroscopic image showing tunneled  Fr () access catheter with tip terminating in the right atrium. IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a  Fr dual lumen tunneled access () line. The tip of the catheter terminates in the right atrium. The catheter is ready for use.
