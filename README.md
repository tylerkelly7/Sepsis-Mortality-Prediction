## 📌 Overview

This project was developed as a Master’s Thesis in Biostatistics at the University of Pittsburgh and focuses on ICU sepsis mortality prediction using EHR data and natural language processing of clinical text.


### Motivation
Sepsis remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units, motivating the need for reproducible and interpretable machine learning approaches to mortality prediction using routinely collected EHR data.

### Objective
The objective is to develop, evaluate, and statistically compare supervised machine learning models for predicting in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with sepsis using multi-modal EHR data from MIMIC-IV.

### Project Summary

This work frames sepsis mortality prediction as a binary classification task with class imbalance.
Models are tuned on the original training data and subsequently retrained on SMOTE-balanced data for final evaluation on both resampling schemes.

The pipeline integrates:
- Data ingestion and preprocessing using the cleaned MIMIC-IV–derived dataset released by [Gao et al.](https://github.com/yuyinglu2000/Sepsis-Mortality)
- Unstructured clinical feature engineering
- Clinical text representation using NLP embeddings (Word2Vec; experimental LLM extensions explored separately)
- Supervised model training with and without SMOTE to address class imbalance
- Rigorous evaluation using AUROC, calibration, and statistical testing
- Reproducible experiment tracking and artifact logging (MLflow)
- A lightweight API demonstration for inference (in progress)

## 🎓 Academic Context

### 📄 Full Thesis Document

The complete, submitted Master’s thesis is available here:

📘 **[Tyler Kelly — Master’s Thesis (PDF)](docs/Tyler%20Kelly%20Thesis.pdf)**

This repository supports my Master’s Thesis defense by ensuring reproducibility and transparency:
- Committee members can follow the modular notebooks.
- Recruiters can inspect the scaffold and MLOps integrations.

This repository is also intended for academic and educational purposes.
Results should not be interpreted as clinical decision support without external validation.

### 📊 Dataset Source

The primary dataset used in this project is the cleaned MIMIC-IV–derived cohort released by Gao et al.:

🔗 **Gao et al. — Sepsis Mortality Prediction Repository**  
https://github.com/yuyinglu2000/Sepsis-Mortality

Specifically, this work uses the cleaned dataset provided in `Data_after_Cleaning.csv`, with all downstream preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation performed in this repository.
